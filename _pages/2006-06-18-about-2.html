My name is James Cook, but I prefer to be called Jamie so as to avoid the obvious comparisons that arise when you share a name with the person who is credited with discovering Australia. That is me over there on the left, I'm a software developer / manager / research engineer from Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. I currently work for <a href="http://www.veitchlister.com.au" target="_blank">Veitch Lister Consulting,</a> managing their R&amp;D team to help deliver transport modelling software.</p>
<p>Previously I completed my Elec. Engineering PhD in the field of “3D Face Recognition” at QUT where I also did my Bachelor of I.T. and Bachelor of Electronic Engineering. I haven't worked in that discipline since moving to the field of traffic and transport forecasting but if (for some strange reason) you are interested in my work, a list of my <a href="http://jamie.homelinux.org/publications/">publications</a> is available for your perusal.</p>
<p>I also have two beautiful daughters, but because this site is for my technical interests I'll save all those photos for my google+ stream.</p>
