<title>How fragile is American Democracy? &#8211; </title>
<meta name="description" content="Americans pride themselves on their institution of democracy, so much so in fact that they are quite willing to forcefully export it to as many countries as possible. But how democratic is America? It is no coincidence that politics is seen by a majority of people as being a dirty business to get into - the reins of power are never lightly seized. If you do some research on Gerrymandering you'll find some interesting reading on how far the parties in power will go in order to stay in power. This brings us to an interesting article ("How to steal an election") over at Ars Technica on how the advent of Electronic Voting (e-voting) has provided the potential for wholesale election tampering,. Forget just pushing all those left-wing nuts into one voting district, what if you could just swap their votes for a nice republican candidate? Scary, scary stuff and there doesn't seem to be much that can be done to fix it before the upcoming midterm elections either. But I guess as long as the next episode of "The Biggest Loser" comes out on time and provides people with the heart-warming imagery of fat people becoming beautiful then the American public will be content. 
My own personal fear is that, by the time a whistleblower comes forth with an indisputable smoking gun—hard evidence that a large election has been stolen electronically—we will have lost control of our electoral process to the point where we will be powerless to enact meaningful change. The clock is ticking on this issue, because a party that can use these techniques to gain control of the government can also use them to maintain control in perpetuity.

update: Another article in the NY Times has coverage of voter suppression, another tactic for derailing democracy. A particularly choice quote:
The type of misleading letter sent this month to 14,000 Hispanic immigrants in Orange County, Calif., threatening them with arrest if they tried to vote, was hardly a first. In 2004, similar fliers appeared in predominantly black neighborhoods in the Pittsburgh area, on official-looking letterheads. The fliers said that because of unusually high voter registration, Republicans were to vote on Election Day, and Democrats were to vote the next day.
