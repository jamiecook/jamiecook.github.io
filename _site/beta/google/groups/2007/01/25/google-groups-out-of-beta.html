<title>Google Groups out of beta &#8211; </title>
<meta name="description" content="Was playing around in the face recognition group that I recently signed up for and was making a post when I noticed something strange going on. Previously when posting I'd been bitten by the disparity between gmail and g-groups, pressing tab from a new email takes to the send button. Hence I normally type the message and 'tab-enter' to send it... unfortunately doing the same thing in groups takes you straight to the cancel button, DOH!!!
So anyways, didn't realise exactly what was going on but I noticed that this had been fixed up. Then I saw this post on the google blog and it all became clear.

Now you can customize the look of your group, create and edit web pages, upload and share files (including photos), and view member profiles. And for your discussions, there's no need to struggle to follow interrupted conversations, as Google Groups now includes the same style of organization that Gmail users love. Take a tour to learn more.
