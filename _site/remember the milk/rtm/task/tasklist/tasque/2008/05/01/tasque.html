<title>Tasque &#8211; </title>
<meta name="description" content="Just saw this app from the Remember the Milk page and decided to give it a go. Tasque is a gnome mono app that allows you to manage your RTM task list from the desktop, which is quite handy for me (I can add stuff straight from gmail but I don't want to have gmail open all day - plus the notes system from gmail is horrible - you have to navigate via three or four clicks back the RTM note taking page yuck!)
However I had some problems compiling from source (seems that there is a debian package but nothing in the ubuntu repositories just yet).
First thing - had to install gmcs

sudo apt-get install mono-gmcs

Then cairo
sudo apt-get install libmono-cairo2.0-cil
Then gettext, this was hard to track down as it manifested as a weird variable $(GMSGFMT) in the makefile in a po subdir not being defined. Thus this rule from the makefile

file=`echo $* | sed 's,.*/,,'`.gmo \
  &amp;&amp; rm -f $$file &amp;&amp; $(GMSGFMT) -o $$file $&lt;

resulted in the following error in the build

file=`echo fi | sed 's,.*/,,'`.gmo \
        &amp;&amp; rm -f $file &amp;&amp;  -o $file fi.po
/bin/sh: -o: not found

To fix that particular one

sudo apt-get install gettext
./configure # (again)

Then it compiled but wouldn't run
System.DllNotFoundException: gdk-x11-2.0
Which I had to install the gtk development libraries to fix (which is weird to me because the binaries are already compiled.. why is a dev package required to run them?
sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev
After all that tho it seems to run quite well.
