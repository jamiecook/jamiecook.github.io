<title>New Google Search features test site &#8211; </title>
<meta name="description" content="Looks like there can actually be too much of a good thing. At least that is what Google have found regarding their brand recognition when testing out new search features, apparently people just love Google so much that they'll like whatever Google gives them. To get around this they have launched a new search site called SearchMash where they are testing out features such as: 

Side by side columns of 'Web Pages' and 'Images'
Drag and Drop re-ordering of search results (why you'd want to do this I don't know)
Context menus that allow you to {'open in new window', 'open in this window', 'open cached copy', etc}
"More Results" which simply adds extra results to the current page (how web 2.0)

But as Ars points out, the problem with such a site is that if you didn't know Google was behind it, would you go there in the first place? Apparently they have methods for driving traffic to their test site but aren't sharing them in the interests of not contaminating their test data.
