<title>Pretty Pictures of Complex Networks &#8211; </title>
<meta name="description" content="Complexity is everywhere. It's a structural and organizational
principle that reaches almost every field imaginable, from genetics and
social networks to food webs and stock markets. Contemporary scientific
and technological accomplishments—including mapping the human
genome, decoding neural networks and opening up the ocean to
exploration—have seen our ability to generate and acquire
information outpace our ability to make sense of it. With a surfeit of
facts and few ways to synthesize them, "meaningful information" quickly
becomes an oxymoron.
I really was just interested in the pretty pictures part though :) They've got images of neural networks from a mouse brain, the interconnecting structure of trees/leaves/branches and my favourite the "The World of Music: SDP Layout of High Dimensional Data" - this comes from Yahoo! music which I'm actually a paying member of... so I guess I helped to make some of these little interconnecting lines :)
