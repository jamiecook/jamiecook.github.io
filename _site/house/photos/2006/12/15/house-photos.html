<title>House Photos &#8211; </title>
<meta name="description" content="Hey all, if I haven't told you yet (and trust me I've been telling everyone I run into) my little sister Becky and I are about to become proud home owners. We've agreed on a contract on a house in Coorparoo and are expecting to settle on it around mid-January. Today however I have some photos from our recent foray during the building and pest inspection.

As you can see from the first photo, the block is fairly leafy and it's set in a little side street (but not too far from a main drag with lots of eateries and shopping and transport). Most importantly though, it has a big old back deck which is nicely shaded by the macadamia tree from next door. The current tenants have a sofa and BBQ and punching bag out there at the moment and it doesn't feel crowded at all.

The interior is all nice and pretty, the floors are bare pine boards and will come up a treat with a polish. The living area is big enough for us and once we knock down the wall between the kitchen and the living room it'll have a nice open feel to it all, with the living moving to kitchen moving to rear deck. Two of the bedrooms have A/C and the third has french doors opening onto the deck, not bad for a current student I don't think :)
