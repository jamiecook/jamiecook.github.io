<title>Gentoo emerge - specifying package version &#8211; </title>
<meta name="description" content="I've been spending the last couple of days trying to figure out how to install mythTV on my gentoo linux box. I'd been having trouble with QT, here is a quick run down of the stages I went through:

the version on my system was 3.3.3 (which is compatible) but hadn't been compiled with mysql support.

Simple solution was to set the appropriate flags in my /etc/portage/package.use and re-emerge the package.
echo "x11-libs/qt mysql opengl" &gt;&gt; /etc/portage/package.use
emerge -1 qt


emerge however wants to install the newest version of QT (4.1.2) which is not compatible with mythtv.

After a lot of searching I was finally able to come up with a solution to what is essentially a very simple problem. Turns out that emerge doesn't like the full package descriptor when specifying versions. So
emerge -1 =qt-3.3.6-r1 
 works, but
emerge -1 =x11-libs/qt-3.3.6-r1
doesn't.

Also there is also a qt3 descriptor for the version 3 of QT
echo "x11-libs/qt3 mysql opengl" &gt;&gt; /etc/portage/package.use
