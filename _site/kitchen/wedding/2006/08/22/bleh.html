<meta name="description" content="It is now 10:45 in the pm and I have just spent the evening cleaning out every cupboard in our kitchen in preparation for our brand spanking new kitchen which shall be installed tomorrow morning. It's actually been sitting around the house in pieces since this morning, it's kind of funny to see a kitchen in it's composite parts scattered about your dining room. But yes, we have a totally new kitchen which should be ready to prepare food by this coming weekend, that is wed-thur-fri of tradies stomping around the place - a pretty quick turn around by all accounts so I'll remain skeptical and prepare myself for a full week of eating take out every night.
Apart from that little piece of excitement, Gill and I went down to the Gold Coast on the weekend to attend the wedding of my good friend Peter and his beautiful wife. It was a beautiful ceremony, very orthodox catholic with the crowd involvement in the prayers but we muddled our way through it okay. Then the reception was held in the most gorgeous golf club house, it was a big old queenslander type building with the most amazing view of the sunset over the course - and knowing Bree's propensity for detail I don't think it was an accident of timing that put us on the balcony at the right time for it. She even remembered that Gill and I were both vegetarians, turns out we were the only two at the reception as well from something like 80 people. Gave the wedding planner quite a scare when we asked her about it prior to establishing that we would be able to partake in the main course.
