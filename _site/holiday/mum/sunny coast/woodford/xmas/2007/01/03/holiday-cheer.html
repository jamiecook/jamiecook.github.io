<meta name="description" content="Howdy all, if you are reading this you there is a passing chance you might like to know how I spent my holidays. Well wonder no more for I am about to share with you the adventures of my holiday break.
Started out by heading north to my mum's place on the sunshine coast, always good to be back there. This time round I was motivated by my recent house purchase to get involved in some home maintenance, I pulled on the gardening gloves and grabbed a crowbar and then it was off to rescue the pavers from encroaching weeds and trees. I wish I had taken some before and after shots because it was quite amazing how far the gardens had encroached on the living areas and how much they opened up afterwards.
That was pretty much a two day affair getting that in order and after that it was pretty much xmas. Had a leisurely sleep in on the day and then after breakkie it was a quick drive back down to Brisbane to pick up Gill from the airport. She had been spending a week in Rockhampton with her family, I say quick but it was a bit of a nightmare, flight was delayed by over two hours and the drive itself was about 2 1/2 hours round trip. But after we got it sorted it was back for a slightly late christmas lunch and then present opening and dog wrapping. In fact lunch was late enough (and large enough) that we didn't need anything to eat for the rest of the day.
The next week was pretty much just spent lounging and gardening at my mum's place. She has 4 1/2 acres up there, and up till a year ago she had horses in the pasture so clearing up that mess provides more than enough gardening work to go around.
We spent our new years eve out at the woodford folk festival with some friends. It's a really big festival and not every one's phone works so we were a bit worried about finding them but we worked it out eventually. We had a really top night dancing and generally soaking up the vibe, I called it quits about 3 but the other guys headed up to the top of the hill for the dawn ceremony which was as always quite beautiful.
After that we went back up the coast and tried to figure out how we were going to get back to Brisbane (as Gill had persuaded me to leave the car at home). Catching a train wasn't as bad as I remembered it even though we were carrying back a bunch of xmas swag - spent an hour and a half playing solitaire on the laptop. Good end to a good holiday, hope you all got as much enjoyment from your holidays as I did. Happy New Year!
