<title>Thai Cooking &#8211; </title>
<meta name="description" content="Although I had totally forgotten about it until I was reminded last week, my mum had booked us in for cooking classes at the delicious Spirit House restaurant. The reason I forgot was that they are so popular that even though it was a Christmas present from mum, yesterday's was the first available class.
The basic structure is that you spend the morning from about 9:30am learning some of the basics of thai cooking and preparing a 3 course meal comprising 5 dishes. Then when the first course is ready you all sit down and dig in, then it's back to the kitchen to cook up the three dishes in the main course (tasting all the while) and the dessert. Then once again it is back out to the deck to enjoy the fruits of your labour (and let me just say that I've never produced such fruits under my own guidance).
The cooking school is set slightly off from the main restaurant so you aren't being distracted by regular diners and the grounds are simply beautiful. They are located up in Yandina (near the Ginger factory) and have a rainforest feel with a big lagoon around which all the building are located. And to top it off there is a dedicated dishwasher on site so no yucky washing up required :)
Photos coming soon!!!
