<title>Brisbane Ring Road &#8211; </title>
<meta name="description" content="My friend Frank just pointed me to this interesting article which details a proposed ring road system for Brisbane (which obviously never happened). It seems like it would have done a great deal to alleviate the problems that are now facing Brisbane as it struggles to cope with it's population boom.
The centrepiece of Brisbane's freeway plan was the Central Freeway – an orbital freeway surrounding the CBD. It was to pass through the suburbs of Spring Hill, Fortitude Valley, New Farm, Kangaroo Point, Woolloongabba and South Brisbane. The aim of the Central Freeway was to link the city’s major radial freeways and expressways together.
While it's a shame that this was scrapped due to the high cost of buying out property owners, the article also illustrates some of the leafy, quiet residential areas that would have been destroyed if it had gone ahead. Even though, a niggardly part of me (influenced by my recent perusal of inner city house pricing) says "So what, it's not like you can afford to live in any of them anyway".
