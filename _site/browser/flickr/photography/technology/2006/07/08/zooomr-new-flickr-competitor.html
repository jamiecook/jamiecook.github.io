<title>Zooomr - New flickr competitor &#8211; </title>
<meta name="description" content="The zooomr site looks like it is a fairly straight forward rip of flickr (which you all know can do no wrong in my book) and from the quick look around that I've had I can't see too many new and excitingfeatures which would persuade me to jump ship. You can add sound to photos, but I can't honestly see anyone doing that more than once for the novelty factor. It does add two intersting features though, the first of which is the ability to label people who are in a photo. This feature could be one of the most incredible things for photo sharing if it is done really well, and will be a so-so affair otherwise. One of the first issues is that suffered by all community driven sites in that different people will label things differently (some of my friends call me James, I normally go by Jamie however) how then to realise that Jamie Cook in photo 782 is the same as James Cook in photo 1089? And also how to tell the difference beween James Cook (me) and say James Cook the famous captain who discovered Australia? I did see a site a while back that claimed to be able to perform face-recognition on photos to tell you who was in them which seems like an admirable task but I don't think it's how zooomr will be doing this.
 
I had an idea a little while ago while doing some work with image databasing and searching. Never really took it anywhere but then noticed that this new site had implemented the same idea in a pretty neat way. The concept is basically that each photo is tagged with geo-spatial co-ordinates as it is uploaded and then other images which were taken in the same area can be easily called up. 

Pretty simple concept but I think that it will help to re-invent how we browse and search for images - well at least it will when all cameras come equipped with GPS by default anyways :) I'm trying not to get side tracked but it's a pet peeve of mine when reading about "web 2.0" and the "semantic web" (or community driven web) is that all the information required to make them useful has to come from somewhere and no one really says where it's going to come from except "the users". Now I think I'm a pretty dedicated and pedantic person but the thought of tagging all the photos I have in my collection makes me go cold all over. I think spatial information, such as geo-tags collected automatically via GPS, would be a great way to increase the automatically available metadata for photos. 
So in summary I don't see anything great that I don't think flickr will be implementing shortly anyway :)
