<title>Thoughts on Firefox RC2 &#8211; </title>
<meta name="description" content="Firefox is now nearing the version 2.0 milestone, with the second release candidate being released last week and positive reviews already starting to surface on the net. The development team have apparently already started focusing their efforts on the next version (3.0) and are soliciting requests for features, you can even download alpha builds for v3.0 already if you are feeling adventurous and have no problems with stability :) .
I installed RC2 earlier this week and have been pretty impressed with it so far with the following exceptions:

Opening new windows in new tabs is awesome - automatically giving them focus is not!
Only about 40% of my extensions currently work with the new version
It's great that each tab has a 'close' icon on it but why did they get rid of the original x in the top right hand corner? When I have a lot of tabs that I want to close it was good to be able to repeatedly click in the same location rather than hunting for individual tabs close button

Hopefully these issues will be resolved as more extensions update themselves to the new API.
