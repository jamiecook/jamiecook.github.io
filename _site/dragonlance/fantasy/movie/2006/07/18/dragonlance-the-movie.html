<title>Dragonlance the movie &#8211; </title>
<meta name="description" content=" It has been a long time since I've read the hero's cycle from Margret Weis and Tracy Hickman's great Dragonlance series, but they were some of my favourite books around the end of high school. That might have had something to do with playing in the same AD&amp;D setting in which the books were set, but I know plenty of people who weren't into D&amp;D who also thoroughly enjoyed the books. So imagine my delight upon discovering that an animated feature length film based on the first book in the series, Dragons of Autumn Twilight, is currently in production. The delight was great let me tell you!
I'm always a little leary when I hear about film adaptations of books which I've loved growing up and have been disappointed on many occasions. However I think that there is too much emphasis placed on "faithfulness" to the original print form, I've enjoyed adaptations much more when I go into the cinema with the thought in the front of my head that print and cinema are two very different types of media and have different strenghts. Books for example are much better able to convey the thought processes of characters whereas a movie has to rely more on narrative to achieve the same effect, which can ruin a movie if employed too heavily.
There will be much conversation regarding the choices made while bringing this book to the big screen: 'was Keifer Sutherland a good choice to voice the soft spoken mage Raistlin Majere?' and much discussion on the relative merits of animated versus live action for bringing the world of Krynn to life. I for one will be happy to wait it out and judge the movie based on it's merits as a movie rather than it's faithfulness to the original books.
