<meta name="description" content="This was my third time back to Chico and it was great to be able to see my family living there again. My father, Wayne, was kind enough to put us up in a penthouse apartment in the centre of the downtown for the time that we were there which gave us a welcome change from hotel hopping. This was really the holiday component of our trip as we didn't have anything planned for Chico except seeing family, it has no real tourist landmarks to speak of so we were able to just hang out, eat, drink a little and watch a lot of Australian Open tennis :) The highlights of this part of the trip were definitely family related, visiting with Wayne (thats the American way of saying 'sitting and chatting') and seeing my sister Annette and marvelling at how my two young nieces, Morgan and Jackie, had grown.
