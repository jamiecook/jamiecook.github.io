<meta name="description" content="In San Fran we stayed just off Union Square (centre of town) in a hotel called the Mosser which was the smallest room (outside of south Korea) I've ever been in. The toilet so small that the basin couldn't fit in and had to be accommodated in the main room :) This was more than made up for by it's great location however; we would literally walk out of the hotel into the hustle and bustle of downtown San Francisco. While in town we did the things typically expected of tourist, we drove across the Golden Gate bridge and spent some time exploring the Golden Gate park which is an enormous reserve to the west of the city which stretches right down to the Pacific ocean. We also had some fun taking a trip out to Alcatraz island which quite apart from it's history as a jail has a very rich military history dating back to the Mexican occupation of California. We then jumped on a guided tour of the town given by a talkative chap named Dom who drove us around in an open top 1924 Ford motorcar which had been refitted with a new gas powered engine (they are big on green over in SF) which could drag it up and down San Fran's incredible hills.
