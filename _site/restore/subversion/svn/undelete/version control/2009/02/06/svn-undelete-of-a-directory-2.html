<title>SVN undelete of a directory &#8211; </title>
<meta name="description" content="Somewhere way back in the history of our project someone (read Partro) decided that we didn’t need a pesky little data folder anymore and decided that it should be deleted. Turns out he was pretty much right because it wasn’t until about 200 revisions later that I noted its absence, so the question was how to get it back again. The first thing I did was to throw the output of the change list into a text file so that I could identify which revision contained the delete

 i=250
 while [ $i -lt 604 ]
 do
   echo $i &gt;&gt; /home/dev/bdk_changes.txt
   svnlook changed bdk -r$i &gt;&gt; ~/bdk_changes.txt
   i=`expr $i + 1`
 done

(apparently the same thing can be done with svn log –verbose &gt; ~/a.text.file). Then after finding that the offending revision was 403 I wanted to copy the directory from revision 402 into my working copy; according to the svn manual this is accomplished using

 svn copy –revision 402 http://svn.server/repos/path/to/deleted_file ./deleted_file

this didn’t exactly work for me tho as I got the following error

 D:\BDK&gt;svn copy –revision 402 http://svn.vlc/svn/bdk/trunk/data .
 svn: ‘/svn/bdk/!svn/bc/617/trunk/data’ path not found

well duh of course you can’t find the data directory at revision 617, that is why I want revision 402 (like I specified)… oh well lets try the following

 D:\BDK&gt;svn copy http://svn.vlc/svn/bdk/trunk/data@402 .
 A    data\PTImporter
 A    data\PTImporter\PtRoutes.csv
 Checked out revision 402.
 A         data

woot! I now have my directory back again!
