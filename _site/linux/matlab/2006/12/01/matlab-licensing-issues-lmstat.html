<title>Matlab Licensing Issues (lmstat) &#8211; </title>
<meta name="description" content="Further to my previous post on compilation issues for matlab under Fedora Core 5, I found out that after getting my machine into a state where it was possible to perform the compilation, some bastard had come along and nicked the school's one and only floating license for the Matlab Compiler... GRRR!!

License Manager Error -4.
Maximum number of users for Compiler reached.
Try again later.
To see a list of current users use the lmstat utility.

I called up the very uninformative techie who deals with this sort of stuff and was unable to get a straight answer on whether it was my crashed session of Matlab that had stolen the license or if someone else had nipped in and grabbed it while I was upgrading from R14 to R2006a. So I had to go and figure it out for myself. Turns out the lmstat utility doesn't get automatically installed on linux systems and on windows systems only exists as a switch to another command. So the upshoot is if you want to know 'who has the licence for matlab toolbox X?' you had better have a windows installation around.
cd \bin\win32\
lmutil lmstat -c c:\MATLAB6p5\bin\win32\license.dat -a &gt; licence.snapshot

Then just have a root around in that file for the appropriate toolbox.

Users of Compiler:  (Total of 1 license available)
"Compiler" v16, vendor: MLM
nodelocked license, locked to "ID=2202"
