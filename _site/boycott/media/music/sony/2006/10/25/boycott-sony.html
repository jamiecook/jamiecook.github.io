<title>Boycott Sony &#8211; </title>
<meta name="description" content="In case you haven't heard enough bad things about Sony (root kits on cds, crippled music players etc) here is another example of their complete disregard for their customers. Despite their unwillingness to sell the PSP in europe they are (successfully) suing the importer Lik-Sang for filling this hole in the supply demand chain. I am unwilling to hand over any more of my cash to sony and would call on you all to look at your own spending in a similar manner. 
"Thanks to Sony's heavy handed tactics, popular game importer Lik-Sang is closing its doors. All Lik-Sang customers are having their orders cancelled and refunded. Any attempt to place a new order redirects your web browser to the news of Lik-Sang's demise."
'Today is Sony Europe victory about PSP, tomorrow is Sony Europe's ongoing pressure about PlayStation 3. With this precedent set, next week could already be the stage for complaints from Sony America about the same thing, or from other console manufacturers about other consoles to other regions, or even from any publisher about any specific software title to any country they don't see fit. It's the beginning of the end... of the World as we know it', stated Pascal Clarysse, formerly known as the Marketing Manager of Lik-Sang.com. 'Blame it on Sony. That's the latest dark spot in their shameful track record as gaming industry leader. The Empire finally won, a few dominating retailers from the UK probably will rejoice the news, but everybody else in the gaming world lost something today.'
