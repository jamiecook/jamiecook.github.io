<title>DMCA comes to Australia &#8211; </title>
<meta name="description" content=" As part of the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the US it is a requirement that Australia pass into law very similar legislation to the highly unpopular (with consumer groups anyway) Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA).
There are a number of reasons that I think this is a bad idea, firstly that in Australia we already have fairly counter intuitive copyright laws such as TV networks retaining the rights to the program guides (so you can forget about having a TiVo record shows automatically) and I don't think that we need extra layers of legislation which make fair-use of media we've already purchased more difficult while doing effectively nothing to dimish piracy.
Some of the things which would be threatened by the new legislation include:

&quot;Unauthorised&quot; DVD players which ignore region-coding and the ever lengthening &quot;compulsory viewing&quot; areas of DVDs which were so rare when DVDs were introduced, and growing longer and longer now they are entrenched.
Programs which transfer "copy-protected" CDs onto your computer/iPod/mp3 player.  See iownmymusic.org.
Any device or software which does something the manufacturer doesn't like in future.  See  Cory Doctorow's ABC interview on this.  The rumours that PlayStation3 games won't be resellable are probably untrue, but we know they'd delight in having that control.  It could be implemented today, and activated (or not) at their discretion, similar to the increase we've seen in use of &quot;compulsory viewing&quot; zones in DVDs.  Similar restrictions could be applied to other media in the future, and if noone can create alternative players and readers, you'll have no choice.
Innovation: the best article on the effects of similar laws in the US was from the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, the world's largest professional technology association.  This month's Spectrum article: http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/jun06/3673
Competition: you can't compete if you have to get authorisation from your competitors or other parties to do so. This particularly applies to small industries, such as Free and Open Source software.  No competition means no consumer choice.
Free/Open Source Software: Australia has a strength in this area, and yet we don't know if Open Source DVD players, or Linux clients to buy music off iTunes (SharpMusique) are legal.  As a result, given the massive, aggressive and litigious nature of our competitors, they are not supplied with our otherwise-full-functioning Microsoft Windows replacement, restricting business opportunities for our growing Free/Open Source service and deployment sector.
Our international leadership in Free/Open Source: Australia has a disproportionate number of FOSS developers, a history of groundbreaking Open Source work, one of the three key Linux conferences worldwide, and a reputation for government understanding at the state level.  Yet this reputation can be scuttled if we show that the highest levels of government don't care and don't understand.  We will not get this lead back, once we lose it.


More information is available from http://www.linux.org.au/law/ and there is a petition you can sign against this. There is also an interesting writeup on the topic from IEEE's spectrum magazine - yes I stole their graphics for this post, I guess that would probably be illegal too.
