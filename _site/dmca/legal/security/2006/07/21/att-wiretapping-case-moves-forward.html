<title>AT&T Wiretapping case moves forward &#8211; </title>
<meta name="description" content="I was very happy to see this article on Ars Technica stating that Chief Judge Vaughn Walker has turned down the governments motion to quash the EFF case against the telecoms giant. If you haven't been following the story, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (a civil liberties group in the US) initiated a class action against AT&amp;T for their co-operation with the NSA in the domestic wiretapping scandal that broke late last year basically stating that the company had been handing out private customer data without the appropriate legal requisitions. 
The US government intervened in the case on May 13, moving for dismissal or summary judgement based on the state secrets privilege. The federal government had played the state secrets card over 60 times since first unveiling it in the 1950s, prevailing in all but a scant handful of cases. In a ruling handed down today by in the US District Court of the Northern District of California, Chief Judge Vaughn R. Walker has denied the government's motion
Perhaps because such statements come so infrequently out of that supposed land of the free, I particularly like this quote from Judge Vaughn:
In his ruling, Judge Vaughn was critical of the government's assertions that allowing the case to move forward would jeopardize state secrets. "To defer to a blanket assertion of [state] secrecy here would be to abdicate that duty, particularly because the very subject matter of this litigation has been so publicly aired. The compromise between liberty and security remains a difficult one. But dismissing this case at the outset would sacrifice liberty for no apparent enhancement of security."
I could not agree more, and it is refreshing to see people standing up to the incredible corruption and fascism of the Bush administration instead of meekly acquiescing.
