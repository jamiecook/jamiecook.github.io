<meta name="description" content="So we started off our overseas adventure in the city of angels, however our first day in the US couldn't have been less angelic. At six hours, this was the biggest time shift that we had to do on our entire west bound journey and the excitement of the thing meant that we didn't get much sleep on the flight. So when we landed in LAX at 7 in the morning we had a very long day ahead of us and not much left in the tank. It was in this sleep deprived state of mind that we arrived at our motel to be told that we were far to early for check in and that the best they could do for our luggage was a storage shed for their maintenance equipment - not having any better offers we decided to tote our laptop with us and chance it. Unfortunately  this meant walking 4 blocks through the *very* hispanic neighbourhood to subway stop and being accosted by random crazy bearded beggars who were making us feel very uncomfortable and the laptop that we thought was safely away from the storage shed was making us feel very much like an ideal mugging candidate. Fortunately this appeared to be more hallucination than fact as we safely made it to Hollywood bollevade (spelling?) without incident where we proceeded to be very touristy and photograph our way up to the Chinese Theatre along the walk of fame. On our second day the walk to the subway seemed much less intimidating and we even stopped to check out some produce along the way before ending up back in Hollywood for the guided tour of the stars homes (so touristy I know). This was actually the highlight of the stay in LA as the Hollywood hills are beautiful and our guide was very charismatic.
