<meta name="description" content="Its been a great couple of days, I've spend the last four nights in Sydney for the biometrics consortium annual conference. I flew down on Thursday morning and despite a small snafu with forgetting the poster that I was due to present that morning everything worked out fairly well. Spent the next two days being pretty bored at what was a very vendor/government dominated event but made up for it with a great weekend of shopping and cafes in the city and in funky Newtown. I brought my camera down but haven't taken very many photos so will try and make it up in the last couple of days down here. I fly back this Thursday so I have a couple of days. 
Gill is doing some work down in Sydney so she has been here since last friday, and will be staying for two weeks. We've been kicking around together doing a lot of shopping and siteseeing (and a lot of eating). She has a half day today so we are going to spend some of it looking around Redfern (don't ask how I ended up in Redfern) and surrounding suburbs before heading back to Kings Cross to complete our tour of the unsavoury regions of Sydney :)
