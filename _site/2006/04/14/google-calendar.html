<meta name="description" content="I know I just posted about google's new voice search but this announcement is really one I've been hanging out for a for a long time. I found this service back when it was still in invite only beta and I've been hanging to get my hands on it ever since. 
I've used the MS outlook calendar application before for quite some time but now that I'm on and off both my laptop and my work computer it got too hard to keep them synchronized and I'd be working on one and miss events from the other. So lets just say I'm stoked about the google calendar and it's automated email integration - I check my email often enough that this will actually keep me on time for appointments.
