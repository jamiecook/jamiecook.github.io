<meta name="description" content="If you've read the Da Vinci code or heard about the current court case playing out in the states in which Dan Brown is being accused of plagarising most of the DaVinci code from another book then this parody site is worth a look (and a laugh). 
Dr. Franklin Harvard awoke to the sound of his "Ass like that"
    ringtone. His eyes pinched against the green glare of the LCD screen
    and the display that said "Private Number".
    
"Hello?" he grumbled.
    
The voice that came down the line sounded vaguely European.  Considering he was in Europe, this was unsurprising.
    
"Dr. Harvard, this is Chief Inspector Jaques Deschanel from some
    special but fairly incompetent French Police unit. I am stubborn and
    short tempered, and don't like to rely on outside help. I'll be brisk
    and abrupt with you, but when we solve this case I'll look you deep in
    the eyes, shake your hands and say 'thank you' so the reader will know
    to like me in the sequel."
