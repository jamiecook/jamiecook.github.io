    a car crash that perfectly illustrates the importance of hands-free
    mobile devices, a Kentucky woman flipped her truck after veering into
    the median, and severed her arm in the crash. Fortunately, the woman
    and her six-year-old daughter survived the crash, and paramedics were
    able to locate the woman's severed arm, which was found still clutching
    the phone she was talking on when the crash began. The woman was flown
    to the hospital in serious condition. Use your headsets, people!
