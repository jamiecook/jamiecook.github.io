<meta name="description" content="Today I finally got my christmas present from Gill, a digital photography workshop with the guys she works for. And I have to say it was worth waiting for, they put on a really helpful and useful presentation which really helped me get a good grasp on the fundamentals of digital photography, esp how the appeture (f/stop), shutter speed and ISO sensitivity inter-relate to one another.
I am thinking I'll also go along to their advanced workshop in a fortnights time aswell. It also didn't hurt that they lived in a beautiful setting out at Karana downs, they have the most incredible view out on to the river from their back deck which is just priceless. These are two shots I took pointed back up towards their house and I'm trying to decide which is a better shot.

    Oh and if you are interested in taking a class in digital photography I'd recommend getting in contact with them via their website.
