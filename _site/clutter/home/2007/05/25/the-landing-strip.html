<meta name="description" content="Just read about this concept which I knew about but had never heard formalised before, Unclutterer Blog defines the landing strip as:
Although it's one of the cornerstones of an organized home, I'm amazed how many folks havenâ€™t heard of the landing strip. The concept it very simple. Organization comes from things having a place and being in their place. Probably the time when this rule is least observed is when we come home. We come from work exhausted, often carrying our work bags, groceries, and the mail. All we can think of is changing into jeans and flip-flops. Stuff just gets tossed down and then later we're too occupied to clean up. If instead you have a place to 'land', and a routine for doing so, you'll avoid disorganization from the get-go.
We sort of have one at our place, but it hasn't really been fully setup so that everything has a place there.... I will be doing that this weekend methinks.
