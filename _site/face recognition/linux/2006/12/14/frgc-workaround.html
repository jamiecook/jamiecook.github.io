<title>FRGC Workaround &#8211; </title>
<meta name="description" content="Our internet access situation at Queensland University of Technology (QUT) is based entirely on&nbsp; keeping a browser pop-up window open on your computer. You log in and your username is associated with that computer (for quota purposes) for as long as that pop-up exists, the problem with this is that when you are running on a linux box in terminal mode there is no way to create such a pop up!! GRRRR!! 
Some of the experiments that I'm running require that xml parameter files are parsed using a XSD schema file which is located on a central (non-QUT) server, of course when the machine tries to go get it all it gets is a 'You aren't allowed to use the internet message'. To get around this our friendly IT support gurus have used the hosts file (/etc/hosts) to redirect traffic to that internet server back to the local machine
      127.0.0.2         www.bee-biometrics.org
Then we created an entry in the httpd.conf file (/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf) which served up the files from a local directory. Basically I used an X session once to download the files and now I can go nuts from the terminal. True story.

      &lt;VirtualHost www.bee-biometrics.org:80&gt;
          ServerAdmin root@localhost
          DocumentRoot /localdata/imageonr/FRGC/BEE_DIST
          ServerName www.bee-biometrics.org
