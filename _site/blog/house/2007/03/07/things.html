<meta name="description" content="Well been a while since I posted here so I guess I should catch up on whats been going on in my life. Truth to tell it's all been pretty boring lately, we've bought the new house and started making some mortgage payments so we are feeling a touch short of cash. Therefore I've been keeping pretty close to home for the main part, the other weekend my mum dropped the dogs off for the weekend while she was at a conference and the younger one gave me a bit of a scare. I took him down the park and he literally played until he couldn't stand up any more, I quite freaked out thinking that he'd gotten tick paralysis but after about 5 hours of running from vet to vet (this was at about 6pm friday night thank you very much) found out that it wasn't anything too serious. Mum tells me he is back to normal now so I'm hoping it was just a freak occurance.
Been out to see Liam play a couple of times, he came runner up at the recent Bar Soma singer song writer contest so good on him. Will be heading out this thursday to check out UK band Elbow when they play at the Tivoli here in Brisbane, I saw them when they came out with Placebo and enjoyed the show (although I was much more excited about Placebo). Doesn't hurt that Liam scored free tickets either :)
