										<h3>Run in with an angry man</h3>
										<p>Posted 10 Nov 2015</p>
									</header>
									<p>So I just had a great ride home that I had to share.</p>
<p>It started when I was filtering up the side of traffic stopped at lights, the lights turned green and I started off at the head of the lights. The guy in the bright blue sedan who was previously at the head, did not like this and proceeded to overtake me on the other side of the intersection with minimal clearance while yelling a mouthful of abuse out the window #classy</p>
<p>I then proceeded to ride home normally only to run into the same car parked at the right turning lights to Sir Fred Schonell Rd (about a km down the road). This guy then leans out the window and continues to yell abuse at me for breaking all sorts of road rules, with ominous "it's your life you're playing with". He then proceeds to race off around the corner onto Sir Fred, and I think, that's the last I'll see of him.</p>
<p>But no, not content with that tirade he must have seen me in his mirror at one of the many lights along sir fred and thought I know what'll make this interaction better.. a photo. So lo and behold as I am riding past the netball courts at UQ (a full 3.3km from where I first encountered this bozo) I see the same car circling back in the opposite direction to me, window down, phone extended out the window waiting for a happy snap. I of course obliged and gave him a thumbs up.</p>
<p>But I wonder at the thought process of this guy that he has taken the time to essentially stalk me along my ride home.</p>
<p>If anyone was wondering why cyclists don't feel safe on our roads, this is a great illustrative example.</p>

										<h3>Building GSL on windows (sigh)</h3>
										<p>Posted 27 Feb 2014</p>
									</header>
									<p>So I wanted to do some numerical computing in ruby (who needs SciPy anyways) so the best advice out there seemed to be to install the GNU scientific libraries (GSL - http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) and then get the comprehensive ruby bindings for it (http://rb-gsl.rubyforge.org/). Sounds easy enough right? Not really... here is how I did it (maybe, I haven't finished yet)</p>
<p>1) Install the FULL MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) - I was able to use the automated installer http://www.mingw.org/wiki/InstallationHOWTOforMinGW<br />
2) Run MSYS.bat (for me this was C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\msys.bat)<br />
3) mount c:/MinGW /mingw<br />
4) mount c:/gsl /gsl<br />
5) cd /gsl/gsl-1.16<br />
6) ./configure<br />
7) make<br />
8) make a cup of tea... and wait</p>

										<h3>Cursor keys in vim</h3>
										<p>Posted 08 Feb 2014</p>
									</header>
									<p>So I've been meaning to post more often for a while so to get myself back in the blogging mindset here is what I'm experimenting with today. I've been doing a lot more work in vim lately thanks to some encouragement from @nkpart and one of things I find myself still doing a lot is using the cursor keys to navigate, especially when I'm in edit mode... but not anymore thanks to this little gem from https://chris-lamb.co.uk/posts/kicking-vim-cursor-key-habit</p>
<p>[code]<br />
&quot; Unbind the cursor keys in insert, normal and visual modes.<br />
for prefix in ['i', 'n', 'v']<br />
   for key in ['', '', '', '']<br />
     exe prefix . &quot;noremap &quot; . key . &quot; &quot;<br />
   endfor<br />
endfor<br />
[/code]</p>
