<meta name="description" content="Well I have been pretty bad about updating my blog of late so I guess
    I'd better bring you all up to speed (coz I know that you were hanging
    out to hear what I've got to say)
    Last weekend Robbie came over to visit on his way up to Montreal for
    the NIST speaker recognition workshop. He arrived on Friday afternoon
    after work and left just before work on Monday morning and we managed
    to squeeze some good drinking into a pretty short time :)
    Friday was drinks in the town of princton, followed on Saturday by a
    walking tour of the borough. That was pretty cool actually, it's
    something I'd been meaning to do, but by actually living here, never
    gotten around to. There are some pretty parts of princeton and we got
    some exercise, it really was a win-win. We went home chilled out and
    then went back to town for some hot thai food (or so we thought), but
    the thai people were pretty rude and told us "Take out only" - the only
    three words they knew apparently. So we went next door to the indian
    restaurant, where they were much more civil (and cooked a mean curry).
    First time I've had Indian food like I'm used to it since I've been
    here (no offence to anyone living in Phili, but the indian food there
    sucked ). 
    We then went back to the bar from last night and reaffirmed that pretty
    much all their beers were poured from the same barrel of (poorly
    brewed) pilsner. The one notable exception was the beer which had
    strong traces of banana essence (but we are pretty sure they just added
    that after they got it from the same barrel).
    Then on Sunday we went down to the shore (which is what they call the
    beach). Although having said that it is pretty much nothing like a
    beach as we Australians are used to it. The first thing you notice is
    the carnival type atmosphere, there are all sorts of side show type
    attractions on the boardwalk trying to seperate you from your money. In
    fact most things there are designed to perform said seperation - the
    beach itself costs you $6.50 to get on it. I was flabergasted, luckily
    I was with the highly flamable Rob, so we had a pretty good excuse
    to&nbsp; go and chill in the pub until my flatmate and his girlfriend
    were ready to go home - as far as I'm concerned a great outing to the
    beach (shore). 
    Now my fingers be sore from typing so I'll leave the plans for my
    upcoming trip to California for next time. Promise it won't be so long
    this time.
    JC out.
