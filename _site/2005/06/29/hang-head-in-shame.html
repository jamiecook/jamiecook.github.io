<meta name="description" content="For being so slack, I've been pretty dead tired with work lately. Gill
    is coming over to visit me here at the end of next month and I've been
    told I have a lot of work to do before I am allowed to go out and play
    :)
    While she is here (I know she doesn't read this so I can refer to her
    in the third person) we are going to be taking a little trip over to
    california to visit my dad and my sisters. We have one week here on the
    east coast, probably going to be staying in NY for a while and showing
    her around my place here in Jersey. 
    Then after a week we are both jumping on (seperate) planes and meeting
    up in San Fran, where we shall hire a car and drive up to Chico. We
    have one week there before we fly our seperate ways. 
    Speaking of New York it is my birthday this weekend and I think I'll
    head into NY with my flatmate Matt and hit the town for a bit of money
    draining birthday goodness. 
    I've been meaning to get some more photos up but my camera has
    developed a problem with the data cable :( I'm in the process of buying
    a card reader so I'll have some photos up in the near future, til then
    have a great one y'all.
