<meta name="description" content="Poor form on keeping a regular post I know but ..... well I have no
    excuse really so I'm just going to tell you all about the latest
    adventures I've been having. 
    Yesterday my buddy Chris and I trekked along the muddy banks of the
    delaware river looking for a rope swing that a friend had recommended
    and given (shitty as it turns out) directions to. So we almost turn
    back after having walked about two miles but decided to press on and
    were rewarded with the most beautiful little slice of river life. This
    rope swing had to be secured 30 meters up into a huge tree and we were
    swinging from about 10 off the water... meaning that when we let go we
    were pretty close to 10 meters above water level. Appartently my face
    was pretty funny as I was falling and I suddenly realised that "hey
    shouldn't I have hit water by now???"
    I also managed to hurt myself pretty bad.. I have an incredible rope
    burn on my bicep which I shall endeavour to post photos of (yes it is
    that bad that it warrants online photos). I also think I sprained my
    ring finger (how I did that or why I bothered to write this escape me
    now). Anyways, adventures, good fun... I think we'll go do it again
    today.
    Peace out&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;
