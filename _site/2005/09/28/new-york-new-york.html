<meta name="description" content="Well I'm a bit late with my posting but I've had an action packed weekend so I shall endeavor to give you all a taste of it. Started out with some hijinks planned for NY with my friend JP, this all went smoothly, we hit the Lower East Side and found some interesting drinking holes, some of which were even "cheap" (ie less than $5 a beer. We met up with some of his friends and played some pool (even winning the occasional game) then had some good ol' NY pizza (best enjoyed at 4am). I then decided that it would be just as easy to catch a train back to my own bed as stay at Jason's place so I went to Penn Station to catch the first of the morning which left at 5:15. I made this safely and thought that all my problems were over, wake up before my station and catch a cab home, be all done in less than 80 minutes.... oh how wrong I was.
Turns out that all the rail networks on the east coast, I heard from Boston to DC quoted by someone, were being affected by some broken power line and that the trains weren't running. Now back in brisbane this has happened before, the city council normally re-routes some buses to run parallel to the train lines so that people can still get to their destination. Not so in New Jersey, even though the trains and buses are both run by the NJT, there didn't seem to be a single person taking control of the situation. After hanging around in Newark for about 2 1/2 hours I was finally informed that I could catch two buses and end up in a town about 20 miles from home - what do I do when I get there I asked, "that is up to you" was the reply. Welcome to Jersey.
So anyways as it turns out when I do finally get down to the bus stop they have managed to route a special bus that will take me to said town without having to connect. There I catch a bus that gets me within 3 miles of my house at which point my very hung over flat mate kindly picks me up. I walk through the door 3 minutes shy of midday. 
Total travel time : 6hr 42min
I shall tell you all of my much more enjoyable sunday trip into NY after I get home from work
