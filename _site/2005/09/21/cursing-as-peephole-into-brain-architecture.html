<title>Cursing as Peephole Into Brain Architecture &#8211; </title>
<meta name="description" content="The New York Times offers this excellent and
    entertaining writeup on cursing and its role in recent studies of the
    brain. The article discusses the universality of cursing across time,
    space, and culture, its varied roles, from linguistic evolution to
    anger management, and its uses in recent brain research. You can also
    read all about the sexual effects of uttering obscenities and the
    swearing habits of sorority women." From the article: "Researchers
    point out that cursing is often an amalgam of raw, spontaneous feeling
    and targeted, gimlet-eyed cunning. When one person curses at another,
    they say, the curser rarely spews obscenities and insults at random,
    but rather will assess the object of his wrath, and adjust the content
    of the 'uncontrollable' outburst accordingly." As someone who plays a
    lot of MMOGs, in my experience this is only mostly true.
