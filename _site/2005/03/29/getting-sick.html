<title>Getting Sick &#8211; </title>
<meta name="description" content="Sleeps left in Australia: 2
    Went out to lunch with my mum and my little sister yesterday... went up
    to the Rue de Paris for some antipasto and pasta - along with too much
    coffee and way to much left over chocolate from easter :) 
    Today I spent the day wandering around Toowong getting last minute
    things sorted, meant to go over Liam's place but totally forgot - sorry
    dude! Got my tax return lodged - after the $100 fee they charge I'll
    still be getting a bit of cash back so that's (obviously) better than
    nothing. 
    Tried cancelling my comm bank credit card and found out it's a lot
    harder than you'd think. They are still processing charges from 9 days
    ago and until they finish processing them they can't give me a payout
    fee which means I can't finalise the card.... GRRR!!!! If it isn't
    sorted by tomorrow I'll crack the shits and let them have it heh :)
    Going to go have 2 for 1 dinners at the Caxton with Joel, Sam, Sarah and Gill now.
