<meta name="description" content="Well last night was a total riot, Amelia and Shannon (from Bon Scotts)
    had driven back up to brisbane for a bit of respite from touring and I
    hitched a lift with them when they came back to Byron. We got down to
    the Great Northern just before the boys went up to do a sound check. 
    It was the first time that I'd heard the guys playing as Bon Scotts and
    I was pleasantly suprised. I thought that the sound was a bit
    reminescent of Gersey and Art of Fighting. Liam would SO fit in down in
    Melbourne.
    The Fagan (or Faagan as it was misspelt on some shows) gig was pretty
    spectacular aswell, lots of peeps on stage and a big full sound. Plus I
    got to drink their rider so I was pretty happy. Then Dom gave me a lift
    back to Brisbane last night which was fricking awesome - and he
    remembered where I lived which is even better considering I was passed
    out pretty good in the back of the car :)
    I'm trying out posting pics from last night... more later
