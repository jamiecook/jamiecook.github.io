<title>Party &#8211; </title>
<meta name="description" content="Had a top night last night... most of my good friends turned up to see
    us off. Thanks for making the effort everyone, and given we are at the
    top of a steep hill followed by three long flights of stairs it was a
    pretty big effort :)
    I managed to get lots of pics - and I'm hoping that if Dylan is reading
    this he'll send me a bunch of his pics so I can post them up too. 
    Spent the day today cleaning up after said party and installing Ubuntu
    linux on my laptop. I'm typing this up on it now and it seems to a
    pretty sweet and easy install.&nbsp; I had to get grub installed onto
    the MBR which I thought might be a bit of a problem for the XP install
    but it seems to be going ok in both modes. I've got gaim installed so
    that I can chat and thunderbird so I can email - both tested and
    working. As is my portable laptop - now if I could just get sound to
    work I'd be a very happy man. 
    Off to bed now catch you all later.
