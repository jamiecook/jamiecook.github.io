<meta name="description" content="God sony music make me angry!!! Plus this one from slashdot - "Sony Warned Weeks Ahead of Rootkit Flap" from which the following comment was shamelessly stolen: 
    
    			Lest we forget, Sony is still shipping CDs with SunnComm's MediaMax
    [ciocentral.com] DRM on them -- ten times as many as the XCP rootkit,
    in fact (that's 20 million CDs at last count, for those keeping score
    at home). It's still just as easy to defeat as it was in 2003
    [slashdot.org], but if you make the mistake of letting it install like
    my wife did, it's fairly nasty. In particular it actually installs before
    you agree to the EULA -- the only difference between agreeing and
    declining is that if you decline, the software is not activated (but it
    remains installed).
    
If you have a device driver named Sbcphid.sys (which shows up as a
    hidden non-plug-and-play device named Sbcphid when active), you've got
    MediaMax and should remove it [cdfreaks.com].
    

    Only the EFF
    [eff.org] has mentioned MediaMax in the various legal claims against
    Sony, and Sony has remained silent about it in public as well.
    Obviously they're not sorry about using DRM at all -- they're just
    sorry they got caught.
