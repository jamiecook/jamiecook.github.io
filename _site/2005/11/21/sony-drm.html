<meta name="description" content="Perhaps you've heard about the issues surrounding Sony's latest attempt to stop you from illegally copying their precious copyright on your PC. To quickly catch you up to speed here is the skinny 411. 
About six months ago Sony started shipping music CDs with a copy protection named XCP from a UK company called First4Internet. The problem being that this piece of software employs tactics commonly utilized by spyware/malware/virus writers to evade detection on your system. The XCP software installs a root-kit which hooks deeply into your system internals and prevents itself from being uninstalled. Now here are the bad parts:
1. The licence agreement (EULA) that you agree to when playing the CD makes no mention of the software2. They provide no means to uninstall the software. 3. Attempting to uninstall the software yourself will result in a disabled CD drive in your computer.4. Having the XCP rootkit running on your computer leaves your computer open to virus writers everywhere because the authors didn't write tight software and while stopping you from copying CDs also stops your antivirus program from successfully removing viruses aswell.5. They previously made you jump through rings in order to even get anywhere near the download page for an uninstaller.6. They are now providing an uninstaller, however the mechanism for removing the software (downloading via ActiveX from the first4internet webpage), leaves you totally vulnerable to any subsequent webpages you visit. Any website author with 10 min of free time can write a script to automatically install their particular brand of nasty virus/malware on your computer without your knowledge - just because you trusted first4internet to uninstall the rootkit that they originally put on your computer. 
To top this all off the company first4internet have apparently been violating the GPL (open source sofware licence) of various software tools in their rootkit. Ironic isn't it that in the name of 'copyright protection' for Sony's music content they have been busy violating other people's copyrights.
