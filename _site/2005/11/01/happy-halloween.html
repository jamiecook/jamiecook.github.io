<title>Happy Halloween &#8211; </title>
<meta name="description" content="Today is the official halloween and I'm sure that many a home owner is cleaning egg off their windows and wishing they had chosen 'treat' but for the older kids halloween actually&nbsp;happened on the weekend. 
Chris and I got together a big crew for a party in Brooklyn, being as how we live in a different state this is a pretty long way to go for a party. But because we were travelling NJT (new jersey transit) we were able to drink  for most of it :) Hell Chris even managed to take a can of beer through his beer funnel (yes on the train)

It was a pretty interesting night, I was dressed as a priest and (as could be expected) got plenty of "raped any little boys today?" type comments from randoms on the subway. From left to right in the picture are Colleen (new girl), Zina the stripper cop, ryan the ghoul, Joy the naughty librarian, Chris as Frank the tank, Krysten as Jackie-O and me as the chlid molestor. 
After we got all the way down to Brooklyn and the girls figured out that they had pretty much come with the only three straight guys in the party were quickly looking to leave for "greener pastures". But the three of us - Ryan, Chris and I stayed and had an absolute blast, there were some very cool and interesting people there - the host was a friend of Chris' from when he was in high school in Cairo and there was a nicely diverse crowd. Zina had her camera so I'm hoping she can provide me with some photographic evidence of the nights adventures. Will post more pics as soon as I have them. 
Also I am thinking about moving this blog to blogger so that people can leave comments - if you are reading this and would ever do such a thing drop me a quick email at jimi _ cook at yahoo
