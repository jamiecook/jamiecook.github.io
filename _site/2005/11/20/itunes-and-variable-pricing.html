<title>ITunes and variable pricing &#8211; </title>
<meta name="description" content="You may have heard speculation recently that Apple is going to start releasing songs on iTunes under a variable pricing regime. Most of these rumors have come from the record label side of the fence and normally come with a "don't you want to pay less for your old favourites" type of message. There are a number of reasons why I think the labels are pushing this and I don't think me getting cheaper music is one of them. 
Reason 1. People are (apparently) willing to pay upto $3-4 a song to get it on their phone and playing as their ringtone. The record labels would love to make you pay 3 times more for that new "hit" because its the one they've spend all this advertising money telling you you want. 
Reason 2. Record labels are still producing albumns under an outdated model where the 2-3 good songs on an albumn would carry the abysmal shite that they use to fill out the rest of the 30-40 minutes. Now that you can pick and choose which songs you want that model is falling flat on its face and they are trying to plug the gap rather than actually producing quality music that you will pay for. This also goes back to point 1 because it is easier to promote one or two good songs.
Reason 3. Price gives a percieved quality to an item. People tend to judge a product based on two criteria: 1) Brand - word of mouth and advertising play an important role in this. Have they heard of it before, will other people know about it, etc. 2) Price - if an item is priced higher people will give it more value in their mind. I've heard lots of anecdotal evidence of this (ie shop keep has a case of noname beer he can't move for weeks, he gets his pricing gun and ups the price four-fold and it's sold before the end of buisness). The labels need variable pricing to influence buying patterns (and recoup advertising costs). Joel on software (who i've never heard of before) has an interesting take on this.
In the end I'm always going to be wary of record labels like EMI, telling me they want to raise prices for my benefit. Incidently there has been no word (except that record labels are greedy) from Steve Jobs on this issue.
