<title>Birthday Bash &#8211; </title>
<meta name="description" content="Hey everyone, that is if anyone still reads this now, prolly not but at
    least I'm still reading. I had my 25th birthday on Friday and despite
    thinking that it would be a bit of a dud affair I managed to get a jam
    packed weekend happening, thanks to the 4th of July celebrations which
    spread it out to 3 days of fun. 
    Friday
    Work finished up nice and early and I went out with a couple of
    my workmates to get a late afternoon climb in. Hadn't been for a while
    but still managed to knock out a couple of good climbs, also makes for
    a nice natural high before I went out in Manhattan for a decidedly
    chemical high. My flatmate got a bit of a crew together and we cruised
    over for dinner and drinks in a couple of sweet bars around his little
    brothers apartment on the east side. 
    Saturday
    Woke up feeling pretty hot in a small NY apartment and made it feel a
    bit better with a bunch of good coffee the next morning and some great
    eggs benedict. Pity about Davenport losing the Wimbledon finals but
    can't have everything.
    Once I got back to princeton after some shopping, I had dinner and went
    out to a cowboy type bar and stayed out until a bit too late. 
    Sunday 
    Did nothing except cleaning up my apartment, grocery shopping and washing clothes.&nbsp; Nothing doing !&nbsp; Sweet!
    Monday 
    Monday started out slow, but it was 4th July so I had to do something.
    So I got a call from my man Chris with a wacky tubing idea, we ended up
    sitting in the hot sun on an inner tube floating down the delaware
    river at a very leisurely pace. 
    Then went back to his place for a bbq with his family which was a nice
    little slice of American Pie. Then two of his friends, Megan and BJ,
    came over and picked us up for a trip into Philli. We got to see some
    awesome acts for free on the steps of the Art Museum, Bryan Adams
    (stoked... not), Rufus Wainright and the real reason that I went .....
    Elton John! I know I could get some shit from people about that but I
    couldn't pass up the opportunity to see someone influential and
    inspirational to so many people. And he was excellent! truely
    sensational. 
    Anyways, it's now Tuesday night and I've hardly slept so I shall leave you with that little peek into my birthday weekend. 
    Ciao
