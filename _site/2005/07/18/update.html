<meta name="description" content="Well all, don't really have a lot to report this week, had a bit of a
    crazy weekend last weekend (again) so this weekend I've been keeping a
    bit of a low profile. We had some friends around on friday night but
    apart from a lack of sleep it was pretty tame. 
    I've been playing with my mum's new laptop for the major part of the
    weekend, if you are reading this mum - you might not be getting this
    thing :) Matt's TV is totally kickarse and can handle the video output
    of the laptop, so I've been running my little dual screen office set up
    most of the weekend. 
    Let me explain more, right now I am typing this on the laptop LCD while
    media player plays an albumn on the TV screen. Nice big visualisations
    going on and sound piped through the bigger and better speakers
    (compared to the laptop speakers). And last night Matt decided to check
    out the latest subscription service from Rhapsody Inc. Once signed up
    (free trial - normally $13/mnt), you get download access to the 300 odd
    movies which are currently playing on the starx movie network FOR
    DOWNLOAD!!! So last night he downloaded the chinese flick Hero and watched it on the big TV and it looked incredible, slightly below DVD quality but not much below. 
    The movie is pretty damn good too, not the fastest moving but
    tragically epic in the traditional chinese style. The use of colour
    throughout the movie was absolutely breathtaking aswell, it was
    directed by Yimou Zhang (who also did "House of flying daggers") and I
    have to say that I've been impressed by both offerings.
    Anyway thats about all from me for now, watch hero if you get a chance.
