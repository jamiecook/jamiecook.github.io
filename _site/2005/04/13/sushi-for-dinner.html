<title>Sushi for dinner &#8211; </title>
<meta name="description" content="Had awesome sushi for dinner tonight (as the title says). First time
	I've had tofu over here and it hasn't tasted like boiled plastic. 
	Was wondering when I'd find time to go open up a bank account, when I wandered up to the cafeteria, which is in the
	building I work in, and found a desk setup looking for new bank accounts. Thats right a bank wanting me to sign up for
	an account... free Checking (what they call a savings account) with
	free internet banking and free debit card. AND if I get my salary deposited
	directly into this account (50), set up and pay some bills online (25),
	use my debit card three times (25) or any combination of the previous
	they will give me free cash up to $100 (50+25+25). Sweet huh and I
	didn't even have to go anywhere :)
