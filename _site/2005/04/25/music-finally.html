<title>Music Finally &#8211; </title>
<meta name="description" content="Well it took most of the weekend, not counting the time I spent in at
	work, to get it working but it is up and running. What am I talking
	about you might ask, why my personal music server streaming out music
	to all comers! Well those comers who are on our wireless network
	anyway. My flatmate has this cool little device which will access
	content on a server (my laptop) and play it out through the stereo. It
	is currently playing through the TV but it still sounds a whole better
	than playing out of my laptop speakers.
	I went out with my flatmate and his girlfriend to some of the local
	bars in Princeton. We had a great time drinking shots of Jagermeister
	and playing darts, it was nice to get out of the house. I haven't
	really done anything much since I been here in the US mainly due to a
	lack of knowing anyone who is not also an engineer. 
	I had to pay for it this morning tho when my boss called me in to work.
	He went out and bought us lunch though which was a nice change.
	Apparently my fortune cookie thinks I have the beginnings of a gambling
	problem and was so kind as to warn me from straying down that path.
	Thank god for that :)
	I'm thinking of buying myself one of the HD based audio players out there but am having trouble deciding. The sony players
	look awesome but I've heard bad things about the bundled software (for
	which there is no alternative and no linux substitute - kind of an
	issue as I hate having to boot into windows). There is of course always
	the Ipod but the battery life is about half that of the sony offering
	albeit with 3 times the storage. 
	Matt also mentioned these tidy little players, 1 Gb, FM radio and 50 hours of play time.... only $200 and all in the size of a stick of gum.
