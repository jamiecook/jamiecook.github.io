<meta name="description" content="Well last night was a very scary experience for me, the first time that
	I've f'ed up something on my linux box that wasn't revertable :(
	I was playing with the sudo (super user do for the unitiated -
	basically the only way to do any thing of importance) and managed to
	break it. So I needed to use this same thing I just broke in order to
	fix the thing i just broke.... Catch 22 and no way out without some
	serious hacking - and booting from cd.
	Got it fixed about 12:30.... margarita(s) we had last night probably didn't help :)
	Went with my flat mate and some of his college buddies for a steak and
	$1.50 margaritas. Had fun, haven't been getting out much as I've said
	before... got some pictures which I'll post seperately.
