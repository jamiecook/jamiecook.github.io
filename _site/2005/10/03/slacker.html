<meta name="description" content="I've finally got some time to sit down and post up the continuation of my previous posting (New York, New York). After wasting half a day discovering the joys of the Jersey bus system, I decided on Sunday that in all likelihood it wouldn't happen again and that another trip to&nbsp;NY was in order. The motivation for testing my luck? The white stripes and the shins both playing in a baseball statdium on Coney Island. Took about 2 1/2 hours to get down there (and back) but that was just the normal trip time no special delays - So it was a fairly time intensive trip. 
Once i got there I bought my ticket and went in when i discovered that I'd been given a ticket up in the nose bleeds and couldn't change it for one closer to the stage (even though both types of tickets were on sale still and for the same price) so I ended up bribing one of the security guards standing between the two sections and got up nice and close to see the Shins. If you are unfamiliar with their music I'd recommend checking them out, they really are the entire reason that I went... the white stripes are good enough and all but if the shins hadn't been there neither would I. So got home at 1:30 and went to work early the next morning - another tired week at work but worth it for the shins. 
There was actually another concert there today (Beck and Belle &amp; Sebastian) which I would have loved to go to but it was simply too far and I had a paper due. But U2 are playing next weekend and I have tickets so i'll have to make do I guess. At work at the moment and about to go rock climbing so I should wrap it up there. Have a good week all.
