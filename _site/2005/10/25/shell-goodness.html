As we all know the linux shell has been one of the stand out major differences between the windows and linux user experience. Some people are terrified at the thought of giving up their "intuitive" object oriented gui, while propents of the command line interface talk of how much more flexible and powerful a textual representation can be. 
Having used a lot of shell scripting in my time persuing my PhD it is somewhat of a disappointment every time I am forced to use windows and it's antiquated CLI. However after reading this review on Ars Technica on the new Microsoft Shell for windows it looks like an alternative to cygwin is finally here. The command set seems to be very powerful and extendable and incorporates many of the best features from such scripting languages as perl, SQL, ruby and bash. Although with cygwin I do enjoy knowing that scripts I write will be cross platform right from the get go, who knows perhaps someone will release an interpreter for linux :)
