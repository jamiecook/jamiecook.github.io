<meta name="description" content="I'm am now back in Jersey again after another fun weekend in NY staying
	with friend Jason. This time Darren and his fiancee Sally came along
	and we all kicked about together - we went to a broadway show on
	Saturday night which was really good fun. We saw Chitty-chitty bang
	bang and I paid $8 for half a small plastic cup of wine - ah the joy of
	playing in manhattan :)
	Today we went to the pallisades mall which is apparently the second
	biggest in the states, bought a jumbo pack of razor blades (at a great
	deal less than the $5 a blade you normally pay) and picked up a new
	shirt. Loving consumer life.
	No photos this time as I left my camera at home but I think last week
	was enough photos of NY anyway. Hope you all have a great week, I dont
	seem to be able to post much during the week (mainly because I don't do
	much during the week - except complain about work).
	Ciao
