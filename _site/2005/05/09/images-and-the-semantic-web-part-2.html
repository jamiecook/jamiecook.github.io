<title>Images and the Semantic Web - Part 2 &#8211; </title>
<meta name="description" content="semantic web 
	Well that just bites for the second time tonight I've lost a
	considerable amount of posting!!!! GAH!!!! This time due to firefox
	crapping out on me while I was editting. Goodbye 20 min musings (not
	much time but I wanted to get this done before going to bed)
	Anyways....
	I've been doing a fair bit of research into the association of
	information with other information (metadata) and in particular the
	association of some semantic information with digital image data. While
	I was using adobe photo albumn to organize my personal photos I
	associated a lot of data (captions etc) with my images. Unfortunately
	this didn't translate well when I decided that Picasa was the bomb and
	that I'd rather use that instead thank you so very much. 
	Hence my fascination with the use of EXIF data to store information
	about my images within the images themselves. The EXIF data associated
	with an image is normally used (by casual digital photographers at
	least) to store information generated by the camera. this can include
	such information as whether the flash fired, the amount of white
	balance, the distance from the camera of the main subject, which
	direction is up (if your camera has a gravity sensor). It can also be
	used to store descriptions of the image itself. 
	This however tends to be more the domain of the IPTC embedded data. The
	IPTC tags are a way for (professional) photographers to associate
	descriptions, captions, authorship and copyright notices with their
	images in digital format (in a manner which can't be easily seperated
	from the image itself). Actually this is misleading, it is easy to
	strip this information from an image if you are thus inclined but by
	being in the same file inadvertent loss is reduced.
	This standard is currently being superceded by the Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP)
	standard. I say standard but it is actually in main the work of one
	company (Adobe) which brought this platform to life. The XMP is based
	upon the Rich Data Format (RDF - sick of my use of abbreviations yet?)
	and is meant as a consistent crossplatform framework for storing
	metadata about an image. 
	I'm still doing my research on this area and would like to get more
	involved, especially at the level of briding the gap between what are
	abstract concepts and the majority of digital imaging users. I'd
	welcome any comments from people who are reading this if any of my
	assumptions or conjectures are bogus. You can reach me at jimi_cook at
	hot mail.com - I am hoping to either motivate bloglines to allow
	comments or to move to a service which does provide this functionality.
	Now for bed.
