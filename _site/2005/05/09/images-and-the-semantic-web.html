	I've also been playing with my Ubuntu linux desktop trying to find some
	good photo organizing software. I came up with a couple of pretty cool pieces of software. 
	The first I found was GQview
	which seems to be a fairly solid piece of work built up from gimp. My
	only complaint would be the fairly slow load time for thumbnails. At
	least for the initial pass of a directory anyway, after that it caches
	them which improves the situation (there is still a situation tho). It
	does however seem to be one of the lightest solutions, it loads the
	interface in next to no time and doesn't seem to unecessarily load down
	the cpu....&nbsp; unlike our next contender. 
	f-spot I found in
	the last place I looked, no not under the cushions on the sofa, but in
	the Graphics directory on my main menu. Apparently it comes pre-loaded
	with Ubuntu linux. It is a bit less mature than GQview being only up to
	the 0.12 version but for that it seems like an excellent piece of
	software. 
	It is based off the great (but sadly windows only) Picasa software
	which is being touted (and funded?) by Google and Flickr. It doesn't
	have the same level of functionality that Picassa does (hey it's only
	version 0.12) but the interface seems to have been taken exactly from
	the picasa drawing board. Given the overlap and quick time to product
	that I'm seeing with f-spot I wouldn't rule out the possibility that
	there was some contribution from the picasa developers. That is just
	conjecture on my part though - don't take it too seriously. 
	The third option I trialled was Gwenview. I was reluctant to install
	this option as it is based on the KDE desktop and I am running a Gnome
	desktop but I bit the bullet and installed the KDE dependencies that
	gwenview required and gave it a bash. It loads a lot slower than GQview
	(understandably) but once loaded is slick and loads thumbs and previews
	quickly (even on this old Toshiba TE2000 Im running on). Like the
	others it still has limitted support for the EXIF tags which I so
	desperately want to edit. 
	In conclusion, all are decent pieces of software but don't really come
	close to the image databasing tools you can find on windows (ie adobe
	photo albumn, picasa). I'm thinking I'm going to give f-spot and gqview
	a bit more of a look in. I've downloaded code for the former and am
	trying to get a handle on how it all fits together - kind of hard as it
	is written in mono and I have no experience whatsoever in csharp. It
	seems to have the best road map for getting meta data tag functionality
	tho so I'll stick with it until it is more whole. 
	In my next post I'll rant a bit more about why I want to be able to edit these tags easily.
