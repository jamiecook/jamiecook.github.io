<title>Katrina’s Real name &#8211; </title>
<meta name="description" content="I know it is cynical of me, but the recent coverage (at least here in
    the states) of Katrina's destruction hasn't exactly ellicited a great
    tide of sympathy from me. Talk of insurance payouts and oil price hikes
    along with some local mayor uttering the words "this is our tsunami"
    have all combined to leave a bit of a sour taste in my mouth. Another
    great quote was this one by Gov. Haley Barbour (Miss.) "It looks like
    Hiroshima is what it looks like," describing parts of Harrison County.
    But I think that there are a few principal factors preventing me from feeling empathy : 

The fact that the entire city is built below sea level on a storm ravaged coast
That the buffer zone of marshlands which would normally protect
    the city have been stripped away by artificial redirection of the
    mississippi.
The fact that there is no acknowledgment that storms such as
    these are a direct product of global warming (which americans
    contribute greatly too and yet fail to even recognise it's existance)

    This article gives some extra information on my last point.
