<meta name="description" content="Well I am now officially returned from holidays, I had my first day
    back at work on Friday and am now enjoying a nice buffer weekend. 
    California was so sweet, we were staying with my dad in Chico and had a
    sweet setup in his pool house. The heat was pretty full on, got up to
    106 (41) at one point and was consistently around the 105 mark,
    translation for celcius - HOT!! But it was a nice dry heat which made
    it very bearable, as did the swimming pool and fridge stocked with beer
    (mmm mexican beer - much better than the swill americans call beer)
    Got to hang out with my sister Alisa heaps and her young ward
    Johnathon. He is a lovely young man just turned 13 and has grown like a
    weed since the last time I saw him. Lovely manners but I think he lost
    a pair of boardshorts that I lent him - bugger. 
    Also got to hang out with my other sister Annette, who had just had her
    birthday. We all went up to the penthouse of Waynes new hotel and had a
    big do up there with a whole bunch of their friends, I started too
    early and had to crash out about 11 (this probably won't suprise too
    many people but it is actually the exception rather than the norm now).
    San Francisco was the last port of call before returning and it was a
    great stop over. The hotel we stayed in was f'ing lush - we got
    upgraded to a suite and I seriously did not want to leave at the end of
    it. We got dolled up and went out on Union Street had some great sushi,
    enjoyed lots of fine beer. Then woke up early (and bleary eyed) the
    next morning for some serious shopping, got some new jeans to replace
    the pair I bought last time I was in SF (stolen from my washing line
    thank you very much). Then went to Haight street shopped drank and ate
    until it was time to go to the airport, was a very hip and groovy
    place. It was apparently the official headquarters of flower power back
    in the sixties and still had a good vibe to this day, they had this
    vaporiser room with the door open and the smell of pot was
    overpowering. No one cared! Sweet!
    Anyway, shaping up to be a good weekend too, went to yoga for the first
    time since being here and met a new friend. But I'll save all that for
    my next post.
