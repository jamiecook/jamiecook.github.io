<p>Well I have been pretty bad about updating my blog of late so I guess<br />
    I'd better bring you all up to speed (coz I know that you were hanging<br />
    out to hear what I've got to say)</p>
<p>    Last weekend Robbie came over to visit on his way up to Montreal for<br />
    the NIST speaker recognition workshop. He arrived on Friday afternoon<br />
    after work and left just before work on Monday morning and we managed<br />
    to squeeze some good drinking into a pretty short time :)</p>
<p>    Friday was drinks in the town of princton, followed on Saturday by a<br />
    walking tour of the borough. That was pretty cool actually, it's<br />
    something I'd been meaning to do, but by actually living here, never<br />
    gotten around to. There are some pretty parts of princeton and we got<br />
    some exercise, it really was a win-win. We went home chilled out and<br />
    then went back to town for some hot thai food (or so we thought), but<br />
    the thai people were pretty rude and told us "Take out only" - the only<br />
    three words they knew apparently. So we went next door to the indian<br />
    restaurant, where they were much more civil (and cooked a mean curry).<br />
    First time I've had Indian food like I'm used to it since I've been<br />
    here (no offence to anyone living in Phili, but the indian food there<br />
    sucked ). </p>
<p>    We then went back to the bar from last night and reaffirmed that pretty<br />
    much all their beers were poured from the same barrel of (poorly<br />
    brewed) pilsner. The one notable exception was the beer which had<br />
    strong traces of banana essence (but we are pretty sure they just added<br />
    that after they got it from the same barrel).</p>
<p>    Then on Sunday we went down to the shore (which is what they call the<br />
    beach). Although having said that it is pretty much nothing like a<br />
    beach as we Australians are used to it. The first thing you notice is<br />
    the carnival type atmosphere, there are all sorts of side show type<br />
    attractions on the boardwalk trying to seperate you from your money. In<br />
    fact most things there are designed to perform said seperation - the<br />
    beach itself costs you $6.50 to get on it. I was flabergasted, luckily<br />
    I was with the highly flamable Rob, so we had a pretty good excuse<br />
    to&nbsp; go and chill in the pub until my flatmate and his girlfriend<br />
    were ready to go home - as far as I'm concerned a great outing to the<br />
    beach (shore). </p>
<p>    Now my fingers be sore from typing so I'll leave the plans for my<br />
    upcoming trip to California for next time. Promise it won't be so long<br />
    this time.</p>
<p>    JC out.</p>
