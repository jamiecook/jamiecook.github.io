<p><a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117957532.html?categoryid=1236&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0">HBO has acquired the rights</a> to turn George R.R. Martin's bestselling fantasy series "A Song of Fire &amp; Ice" into a dramatic series to be written and exec produced by David Benioff and D.B. Weiss.</p>
<p>The series will begin with the 1996 first book, "A Game of Thrones," and the intention is for each novel (they average 1,000 pages each) to fuel a season's worth of episodes. Martin has nearly finished the fifth installment, but won't complete the seven-book cycle until 2011.</p>
