<p>Well I've been up since 5:30am this morning taking my friend adam out to the airport for his return to Japan. He's been in town for a whirlwind 2 day visit and staying with us while here. Adam used to live with myself and my other friend Batya in Paddington before he chucked it in for a 1 room apartment in Osake and last night we were able to get a reunion of sorts happening at the Sultans Kitchen in Paddington. Lots of good food and good friends - lovely! I'll post photos here when Adam gets round to uploading them.</p>
