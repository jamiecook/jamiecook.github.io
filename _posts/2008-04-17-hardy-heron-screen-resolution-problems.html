<p>Just upgraded my home system to the latest Ubuntu distro and had a bit of a strange problem while fiddling with my xorg.conf. I accidently overwrote the file using dexconf and suddenly my screen resolution options dialog only had 800x600 and 640x480 as the available options. Given that I have 23" widescreen that is capable of 1600x1050 this is rather distressing, especially when I edited my xorg file and still couldn't get any more options to appear, this is (I think) caused by the changes to X in hardy heron which aim to make it easier to configure. Luckily I found a solution by re-installing the nvidia driver using envy</p>
<pre>
sudo apt-get install envyng-gtk
sudo apt-get install nvidia-settings
envyng -g
</pre>
<p>Then follow onscreen instructions, reboot and then run</p>
<pre>
nvidia-settings
</pre>
<p>where I was finally able to select an appropriate resolution.</p>
