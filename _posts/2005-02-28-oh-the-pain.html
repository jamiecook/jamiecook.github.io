<p>Well if there is one place I can safely bemoan my pains it's here in my<br />
blog, thats what most people use these things for right? Well just to<br />
keep up with the Jones my back is giving me some almight pain at the<br />
moment, wasn't doing too well on friday but then helped my mate Joel<br />
move on Saturday and been pretty much in pain ever since, I'm headingin<br />
in to yoga today so I'm hoping that will help to fix it up a bit.<br />
Stretching yesterday really helped anyway.</p>
<p>And just realised that I forgot to pick up the hard drive/ enclosure<br />
that I ordered on friday, gill is headed that way now to pick it up for<br />
me. </p>
<p>Peace out <br />
J</p>
