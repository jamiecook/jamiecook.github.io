<p>You've probably heard by now how M$ pulled an 11th hour turnaround on their plans to allow the virtualisation of Vista Home and Basic editions. This has been attributed by some to piracy fears but that doesn't really sit right. The guys over at Ars Technica are sharp as always and point out that it probably has more to do with fears that Vista could be sold alongside Mac OS X on apple hardware and run as second fiddle to the apple OS.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Now imagine Apple running adverts on the TV that say: with a Mac, you can get the best of both worlds by adding Windows Vista to your Mac for $99. "Get a Mac, then add a PC for $99!"</p>
<p>All of this paints a picture in which Apple could use OEM pricing to offer Windows for its Macs at greatly reduced prices and running in a VM.

<p>Now that sounds a bit more like why MS are shitting themselves. I saw my neighbour at uni running windows in a VMware session on his Fedora Core box and I have to say it was eerily good looking. Got kind of weird though when he downloaded and installed putty then ssh'd back to the box on which the VMware session was running... spooky!</p>
