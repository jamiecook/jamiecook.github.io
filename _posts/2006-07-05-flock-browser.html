<p>I installed the 0.7.1 version of the new flock browser yesterday and thought I'd post a few of my thoughts (and try out the integrated flickr features). The first thing I did upon setting up the browser was to give it my flickr account details - this is where I first ran into trouble. My girlfriend had her flickr account signed in and flock automatically redirected me to a page asking if I wanted to give flock permissions <strong>under her account</strong>. If it had been my account signed in it would have worked straight away but trying to change the login to my account involved a serious amount of fiddling and a restart of that portion of the installer (for some reason the back butttons on the installer weren't working). </p>
<p><a title="Sydney - Centerpoint Tower" href="http://flickr.com/photos/86282888@N00/171656253"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/171656253_40d7a59d2b_m.jpg" /></a> But eventually I did get it updated correctly and had access to all my photos from the photo strip which sits atop the tab space. It pops up my photostream with the latest photos first and provides some basic functions like favourite button and a drop down box showing which of your contacts has new photos available - clicking on any contact will display their photo stream in the strip. What I really wanted to try out though was the drag and drop function - which is why I'm writing this post really. To the left is a photo of centerpoint tower in Sydney which I took with my phone, I simply dragged it into the wordpress editor and voila... photo in my blog. I had been a bit worried that the WYSIWYG editor wouldn't understand the html that was being dropped in but that didn't seem to be a problem. </p>
<p>The only other thing that I've had a problem with so far is the built in search. As far as I can tell firefox's quick search functionality has not been included with flock - my setup of firefox involves setting the google quick search to 'g' (I know David simply uses '?'), my process for searching is then 1) Ctrl-T (new tab) 2) Alt-D (highlight address bar) 3) type "g my search string" and I have a new google window with the search results I want without ever having to take my hands off the keyboard. Missing this little piece of functionality could be a deal breaker for me... I'll have to give it a bit more time to see. I'm also a bit miffed with the search bar, the default is yahoo for a start and I'm not sure what has happened to the I'm feeling lucky search (in firefox typing a search into the address bar would give you the I'm feeling lucky result from google). </p>
<p>Finally the integrated RSS reader seems to work just fine, adding new feeds is easy and the icons are prominently displayed. The reader itself is very easy on the eyes with the one exception of squashing images, I read a lot of comics and when the strip is comressed 50% it makes it impossible to read the included text.</p>
<p>Thats it for now, I'll put up some screenshots later if I feel inclined.</p>
