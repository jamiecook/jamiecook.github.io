<p><font face="Courier" size="3"><br />
      Telemarketers make use of a telescript - a guideline for a telephone<br />
      conversation. This script creates an imbalance in the conversation<br />
      between the marketer and the consumer. It is this imbalance,<br />
      most of all, that makes telemarketing successful. The <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/%7Eegbg/counterscript.html" title="Link outside of this blog">EGBG Counterscript</a><br />
      attempts to redress that balance.</font></p>
