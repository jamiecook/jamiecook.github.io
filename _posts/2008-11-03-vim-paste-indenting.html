<p>You know how it goes, you want to paste some code into a file that you are editing, but for some reason each line is indented from the previous line until there is no room left on your screen! The solution is to add the following to your ~/.vimrc</p>
<p><code><br />
set pastetoggle=<br />
</code><br />
then you can use F6 to turn autoindent on and off at will :)</p>
