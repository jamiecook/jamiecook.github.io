<p>Had a top night last night... most of my good friends turned up to see<br />
    us off. Thanks for making the effort everyone, and given we are at the<br />
    top of a steep hill followed by three long flights of stairs it was a<br />
    pretty big effort :)</p>
<p>    I managed to get lots of pics - and I'm hoping that if Dylan is reading<br />
    this he'll send me a bunch of his pics so I can post them up too. </p>
<p>    Spent the day today cleaning up after said party and installing Ubuntu<br />
    linux on my laptop. I'm typing this up on it now and it seems to a<br />
    pretty sweet and easy install.&nbsp; I had to get grub installed onto<br />
    the MBR which I thought might be a bit of a problem for the XP install<br />
    but it seems to be going ok in both modes. I've got gaim installed so<br />
    that I can chat and thunderbird so I can email - both tested and<br />
    working. As is my portable laptop - now if I could just get sound to<br />
    work I'd be a very happy man. </p>
<p>    Off to bed now catch you all later.</p>
