<p>I'm sure that anyone who is now using gmail is familiar with Google's<br />
	practise of keeping their offering in "beta" stage for execessively<br />
	long periods of time. And in the case of Google Groups moving them back<br />
	into "beta". But I'll bet that this is one beta that most people<br />
	wouldn't be expecting to see.</p>
