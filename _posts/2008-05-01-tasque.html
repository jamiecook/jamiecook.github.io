<p>Just saw <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Tasque">this app</a> from the <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember the Milk</a> page and decided to give it a go. Tasque is a gnome mono app that allows you to manage your RTM task list from the desktop, which is quite handy for me (I can add stuff straight from gmail but I don't want to have gmail open all day - plus the notes system from gmail is horrible - you have to navigate via three or four clicks back the RTM note taking page yuck!)</p>
<p>However I had some problems compiling from source (seems that there is a debian package but nothing in the ubuntu repositories just yet).</p>
<p>First thing - had to install gmcs</p>
<p><code><br />
sudo apt-get install mono-gmcs<br />
</code></p>
<p>Then cairo</p>
<p><code>sudo apt-get install libmono-cairo2.0-cil</code></p>
<p>Then gettext, this was hard to track down as it manifested as a weird variable $(GMSGFMT) in the makefile in a po subdir not being defined. Thus this rule from the makefile</p>
<pre><code>
file=`echo $* | sed 's,.*/,,'`.gmo \
  &amp;&amp; rm -f $$file &amp;&amp; $(GMSGFMT) -o $$file $&lt;
</code></pre>
<p>resulted in the following error in the build</p>
<pre><code>
file=`echo fi | sed 's,.*/,,'`.gmo \
        &amp;&amp; rm -f $file &amp;&amp;  -o $file fi.po
/bin/sh: -o: not found
</code></pre>
<p>To fix that particular one</p>
<pre><code>
sudo apt-get install gettext
./configure # (again)
</code></pre>
<p>Then it compiled but wouldn't run</p>
<p><code>System.DllNotFoundException: gdk-x11-2.0</code></p>
<p>Which I had to install the gtk development libraries to fix (which is weird to me because the binaries are already compiled.. why is a dev package required to run them?</p>
<p><code>sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev</code></p>
<p>After all that tho it seems to run quite well.</p>
