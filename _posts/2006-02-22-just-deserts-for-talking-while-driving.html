<p>The following is ripped directly from the <a href="http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/" title="Link outside of this blog">wired gadgets blog.<br /></a><br /><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/womanonphone.jpg" align="right" /><i>In<br />
    a car crash that perfectly illustrates the importance of hands-free<br />
    mobile devices, a Kentucky woman flipped her truck after veering into<br />
    the median, and severed her arm in the crash. Fortunately, the woman<br />
    and her six-year-old daughter survived the crash, and paramedics were<br />
    able to locate the woman's severed arm, which was found still clutching<br />
    the phone she was talking on when the crash began. The woman was flown<br />
    to the hospital in serious condition. Use your headsets, people!<br />
