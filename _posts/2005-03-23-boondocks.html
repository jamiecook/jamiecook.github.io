<p><b>Days left in the country: 8</p>
<p>    </b>Well Gill and I stayed out at Bellbowrie with her aunt Joan last<br />
    night. I've gotten so used to living close to the city that it was a<br />
    pretty huge shock to have to drive an hour (thru peak hour) just to get<br />
    to Toowong (which is further from the city than our apartment). </p>
<p>    Went and did a little poking around in the shopping center for some new<br />
    buisness shirts and didn't buy anything. And tried to get my USB HD<br />
    enclosure replaced - no luck, come back in a day they said :(. After 8<br />
    days of owning the bloody thing one of the inductor coils drops off the<br />
    PCB, should have demanded better response than that but I was too woosy<br />
    :)</p>
