<p>I'm sure that at least some of you heard that silly internet rumour<br />
	going around a little while ago (around 1st of April if memory serves).<br />
	Google had just announced their new satellite imagery acquisition and<br />
	some people would have you believe that if you stood out side your<br />
	house looking like a goose and waving at the sky that you'd come out as<br />
	a blurry blob on their maps.</p>
<p>	I gave it a miss but apparently they occasionally capture some <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,67190,00.html#" title="Link outside of this blog">really interesting things</a> during their automated sweeps. </p>
