<p>If you haven't been following the story, the $100 laptop is an initiative cooked up by millionaire philanthropist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Negroponte" title="Link outside of this blog">Nicholas Negroponte</a> to provide cheap laptops to kids in Africa. That is a very condensed version of the story, but it is the essence - check out the <a href="http://www.laptop.org/" title="Link outside of this blog">official site</a> for more information. </p>
<p>The rhetoric and opinions have been flying over this program ever since it was first announced but now I am happy to say that there is a physical product which we can all "ooohhh and aahhh" over - MIT has produced the first prototypes of the $100 laptop and pictures are available at (and it makes me very happy to say it) <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pete/sets/72057594143224765/" title="Link outside of this blog">flickr</a>. </p>
