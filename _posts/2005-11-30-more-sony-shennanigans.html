<p>God <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20051129-5641.html" title="Link outside of this blog">sony music</a> make me angry!!! Plus this one from slashdot - "<a href="http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/11/29/1823212&amp;from=rss" title="Link outside of this blog">Sony Warned Weeks Ahead of Rootkit Flap</a>" from which the following comment was shamelessly stolen: </p>
<p>    <i><br />
    			Lest we forget, Sony is </i><a href="http://www.ciocentral.com/article/Sonys+DRM+It+Just+Keeps+Getting+Worse/165201_1.aspx" title="ciocentral.com">still shipping CDs with SunnComm's MediaMax</a><br />
    [ciocentral.com] DRM on them -- ten times as many as the XCP rootkit,<br />
    in fact (that's 20 million CDs at last count, for those keeping score<br />
    at home). It's still just as easy to defeat as it was <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/10/09/2211259" title="slashdot.org">in 2003</a><i><br />
    [slashdot.org], but if you make the mistake of letting it install like<br />
    my wife did, it's fairly nasty. In particular it actually installs </i><i>before</i><i><br />
    you agree to the EULA -- the only difference between agreeing and<br />
    declining is that if you decline, the software is not activated (but it<br />
    remains installed).<br />
    </i></p>
<p>If you have a device driver named Sbcphid.sys (which shows up as a<br />
    hidden non-plug-and-play device named Sbcphid when active), you've got<br />
    MediaMax and should <a href="http://club.cdfreaks.com/showthread.php?t=154811" title="cdfreaks.com">remove it</a> [cdfreaks.com].
    </p>
<p>
    Only the <a href="http://www.eff.org/IP/DRM/Sony-BMG/" title="eff.org">EFF</a><br />
    [eff.org] has mentioned MediaMax in the various legal claims against<br />
    Sony, and Sony has remained silent about it in public as well.<br />
    Obviously they're not sorry about using DRM at all -- they're just<br />
    sorry they got caught.</p>
