<p>I know it is cynical of me, but the recent coverage (at least here in<br />
    the states) of Katrina's destruction hasn't exactly ellicited a great<br />
    tide of sympathy from me. Talk of insurance payouts and oil price hikes<br />
    along with some local mayor uttering the words "this is our tsunami"<br />
    have all combined to leave a bit of a sour taste in my mouth. Another<br />
    great quote was this one by Gov. Haley Barbour (Miss.) "It looks like<br />
    Hiroshima is what it looks like," describing parts of Harrison County.</p>
<p>    But I think that there are a few principal factors preventing me from feeling empathy : </p>
<ul>
<li>The fact that the entire city is built below sea level on a storm ravaged coast</li>
<li>That the buffer zone of marshlands which would normally protect<br />
    the city have been stripped away by artificial redirection of the<br />
    mississippi.</li>
<li>The fact that there is no acknowledgment that storms such as<br />
    these are a direct product of global warming (which americans<br />
    contribute greatly too and yet fail to even recognise it's existance)</li>
</ul>
