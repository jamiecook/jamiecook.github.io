<p>Today I had a chilled out day, managed to actually get a full 8 hours<br />
    of sleep, which was a delicious change of pace. Then apartment cleaning<br />
    chewed up what remained of my morning - that just left a beautiful<br />
    sunny afternoon to take my new bike out and explore some more of<br />
    princeton. </p>
<p>    Once I got out there I realised that I should definetly have taken my<br />
    camera becuase the countryside was really pretty - but then again<br />
    pretty doesn't naturally translate to picturesque so maybe it's just<br />
    better to describe. So then I went and hung around the township of<br />
    princeton, managed to keep my impulse for espresso down to an iced<br />
    green tea and an iced herbal tea. Now I'm off to play a game of tennis<br />
    and see if I can keep the slight tan that I managed to acquire while on<br />
    holidays. </p>
<p>    Oh and we got a new espresso machine at home, tis way snazzy - seperate foam control knob and everything :) Life is good!</p>
