<div align="center">
<div align="left">As promised I have photographic evidence of the rope burn I gave myself at the rope swing yesterday.
    </div>
<div align="center"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/42556572_2eaab86095_m.jpg" /></p>
<div align="left">And you might notice that there are two<br />
    burns there... well I decided that I hadn't done enough to hurt myself<br />
    on Saturday so I went back again today to try again but I could only<br />
    get a smaller version of the first one (left).</p>
<p>    I am tired and ready to go to bed now... peace out&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;
