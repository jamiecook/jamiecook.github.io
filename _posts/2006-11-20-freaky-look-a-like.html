<p>Was just doing some reading on practical uses of face-recognition and came across this article (not anything to do with automated Face-Rec). The girls in this article look so alike that I'm still not convinced that they aren't the same person, I know that any software that I've written would have trouble telling them apart. Apparently the girl on the right spent a week in jail and had her name smeared in local media for a crime the other girl helped commit (despite the fact that she was 17 years old at the time)</p>
