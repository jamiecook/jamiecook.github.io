<p>	Well that just bites for the second time tonight I've lost a<br />
	considerable amount of posting!!!! GAH!!!! This time due to firefox<br />
	crapping out on me while I was editting. Goodbye 20 min musings (not<br />
	much time but I wanted to get this done before going to bed)</p>
<p>	Anyways....</p>
<p>	I've been doing a fair bit of research into the association of<br />
	information with other information (metadata) and in particular the<br />
	association of some semantic information with digital image data. While<br />
	I was using adobe photo albumn to organize my personal photos I<br />
	associated a lot of data (captions etc) with my images. Unfortunately<br />
	this didn't translate well when I decided that Picasa was the bomb and<br />
	that I'd rather use that instead thank you so very much. </p>
<p>	Hence my fascination with the use of EXIF data to store information<br />
	about my images within the images themselves. The EXIF data associated<br />
	with an image is normally used (by casual digital photographers at<br />
	least) to store information generated by the camera. this can include<br />
	such information as whether the flash fired, the amount of white<br />
	balance, the distance from the camera of the main subject, which<br />
	direction is up (if your camera has a gravity sensor). It can also be<br />
	used to store descriptions of the image itself. </p>
<p>	This however tends to be more the domain of the IPTC embedded data. The<br />
	IPTC tags are a way for (professional) photographers to associate<br />
	descriptions, captions, authorship and copyright notices with their<br />
	images in digital format (in a manner which can't be easily seperated<br />
	from the image itself). Actually this is misleading, it is easy to<br />
	strip this information from an image if you are thus inclined but by<br />
	being in the same file inadvertent loss is reduced.</p>
<p>	This standard is currently being superceded by the <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/09/22/xmp.html" title="Link outside of this blog">Extensible Metadata Platform</a> (<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/xmp/main.html" title="Link outside of this blog">XMP</a>)<br />
	standard. I say standard but it is actually in main the work of one<br />
	company (Adobe) which brought this platform to life. The XMP is based<br />
	upon the Rich Data Format (RDF - sick of my use of abbreviations yet?)<br />
	and is meant as a consistent crossplatform framework for storing<br />
	metadata about an image. </p>
<p>	I'm still doing my research on this area and would like to get more<br />
	involved, especially at the level of briding the gap between what are<br />
	abstract concepts and the majority of digital imaging users. I'd<br />
	welcome any comments from people who are reading this if any of my<br />
	assumptions or conjectures are bogus. You can reach me at jimi_cook at<br />
	hot mail.com - I am hoping to either motivate bloglines to allow<br />
	comments or to move to a service which does provide this functionality.</p>
<p>	Now for bed.</p>
