<p>I'd be almost positive that it's not out in Australia yet but wouldn't<br />
    it be cool to have one of these set up atop your apartment?</p>
<p> <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/wireless/samsung-30mile-cordless-phone-036608.php" title="Link outside of this blog">30 Mile Cordless Phone</a></p>
<p>    If youâ€™re the type who dreads being dragged kicking and screaming into<br />
    the use of a cell phone, Samsung sells their Long Range Cordless Phone.<br />
    With an incredible (for landlines) 30-mile range, the set includes a<br />
    caller ID-capable LCD and is able to communicate with the base-station,<br />
    acting as an intercom.</p>
