<p><b>Sleeps left in Australia: 2</b></p>
<p>    Went out to lunch with my mum and my little sister yesterday... went up<br />
    to the Rue de Paris for some antipasto and pasta - along with too much<br />
    coffee and way to much left over chocolate from easter :) </p>
<p>    Today I spent the day wandering around Toowong getting last minute<br />
    things sorted, meant to go over Liam's place but totally forgot - sorry<br />
    dude! Got my tax return lodged - after the $100 fee they charge I'll<br />
    still be getting a bit of cash back so that's (obviously) better than<br />
    nothing. </p>
<p>    Tried cancelling my comm bank credit card and found out it's a lot<br />
    harder than you'd think. They are still processing charges from 9 days<br />
    ago and until they finish processing them they can't give me a payout<br />
    fee which means I can't finalise the card.... GRRR!!!! If it isn't<br />
    sorted by tomorrow I'll crack the shits and let them have it heh :)</p>
<p>    Going to go have 2 for 1 dinners at the Caxton with Joel, Sam, Sarah and Gill now. </p>
<p>    Jamie out</p>
