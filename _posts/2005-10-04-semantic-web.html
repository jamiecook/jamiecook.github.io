<p>I just saw this great demonstration of how the semantic web can be used to enhance and augment a web page. Check out this new feature from <a href="http://beta.news.com.com/2001-1_3-0.html?tag=ne.tab.hd" title="Link outside of this blog">C|NET</a>. Basically just click on a story and a flash app will pop up alongside it which shows how the current story is related to other stories on the site. Very handy, me likes.</p>
