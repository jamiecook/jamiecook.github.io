<p>Kind of scary really... I wonder if I can pick up some cheap CC purchases while I am over there :)</p>
<p>    <a href="http://www.zug.com/us/jhargrav/" title="Link outside of this blog">Credit card signatures: useless?</a></p>
<p>    SpaceAdmiral writes "Everyone should remember John Hargrave's classic<br />
    Credit Card Prank on Zug. He tried signing fake names on his credit<br />
    card receipt, and no one seemed to care. But that's nothing compared to<br />
    The Credit Card Prank, Part 2. Can he draw obscene pictures instead of<br />
    signing his credit card? Yes, it turns out. Is there any way of getting<br />
    your signature checked? . . . Yes, it turns out. But you have to do an<br />
    awful lot."</p>
