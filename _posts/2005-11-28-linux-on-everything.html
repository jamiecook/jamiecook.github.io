<p>Reading <a href="http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/11/27/166248" title="Link outside of this blog">slashdot </a>one will often see comments of the 'yes, but does it run linux?' ilk whenever any new product or application is mentioned. This is due to the masochistic nature of some linux hackers (known as the "linux on everything" movement) who see the need to get linux to run on just about anything with a power cable from <a href="http://www.xbox-linux.org/wiki/Main_Page" title="Link outside of this blog">x-boxs</a>, and <a href="http://ipodlinux.org/Main_Page" title="Link outside of this blog">ipods</a> to fridges and <a href="http://www.riverdale.k12.or.us/linux/toaster/" title="Link outside of this blog">toasters </a>and in some cases even things without a processor :) </p>
<p>I give to you the <a href="http://www.strangehorizons.com/2004/20040405/badger.shtml" title="Link outside of this blog">HOWTO: Installing Linux on a Dead Badger</a>
