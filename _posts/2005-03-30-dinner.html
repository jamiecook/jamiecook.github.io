<p><b>Hours left in Australia: 24</b></p>
<p>    It's getting very close now... just a couple more things to do and then<br />
    I'll be all done... like picking up my tickets and travel insurance.<br />
    That kind of stuff ;)</p>
<p>    Went to the caxton for 2 for 1 meals last night... ate way too much as<br />
    I always do have some photos below. Oh and Sam &amp; Sarah got me that<br />
    red scarf to keep me warm while I was away - they're the best. </p>
