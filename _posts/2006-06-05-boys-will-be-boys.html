<p>That doesn't stop the american media from wringing every last little bit of&nbsp;hype from what would otherwise be a very run of the mill <a href="http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/porn/playstation-pornable-plucking-hussies-out-of-thin-air-177476.php" title="Link outside of this blog">story</a>. Apparently some kids was watching porn on his Playstation Portable (PSP) at school and the media has been running with it (probably because it is also a gaming machine). All props go to <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/" title="Link outside of this blog">Penny-Arcade</a> for this delightfully succinct piece of satire. <br /><a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/images/2006/20060602.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/20060602.jpg" /></a></p>
