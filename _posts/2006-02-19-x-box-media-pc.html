<p>This one is pretty much for my own later reference, been thinking about buying a cheap second hand x-box and modding it up and this guide gives you a no-soldering solution to hacking&nbsp; your x-box and installing a streaming media center on it. Thats right you can stream all those mp3s straight from your PC to your stereo with this bad boy :)</p>
