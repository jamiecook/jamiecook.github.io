<p>Hey everyone, that is if anyone still reads this now, prolly not but at<br />
    least I'm still reading. I had my 25th birthday on Friday and despite<br />
    thinking that it would be a bit of a dud affair I managed to get a jam<br />
    packed weekend happening, thanks to the 4th of July celebrations which<br />
    spread it out to 3 days of fun. </p>
<p>    <b>Friday</p>
<p>    </b>Work finished up nice and early and I went out with a couple of<br />
    my workmates to get a late afternoon climb in. Hadn't been for a while<br />
    but still managed to knock out a couple of good climbs, also makes for<br />
    a nice natural high before I went out in Manhattan for a decidedly<br />
    chemical high. My flatmate got a bit of a crew together and we cruised<br />
    over for dinner and drinks in a couple of sweet bars around his little<br />
    brothers apartment on the east side. </p>
<p>    <b>Saturday</b></p>
<p>    Woke up feeling pretty hot in a small NY apartment and made it feel a<br />
    bit better with a bunch of good coffee the next morning and some great<br />
    eggs benedict. Pity about Davenport losing the Wimbledon finals but<br />
    can't have everything.</p>
<p>    Once I got back to princeton after some shopping, I had dinner and went<br />
    out to a cowboy type bar and stayed out until a bit too late. </p>
<p>    <b>Sunday</b> </p>
<p>    Did nothing except cleaning up my apartment, grocery shopping and washing clothes.&nbsp; Nothing doing !&nbsp; Sweet!</p>
<p>    <b>Monday</b> </p>
<p>    Monday started out slow, but it was 4th July so I had to do something.<br />
    So I got a call from my man Chris with a wacky tubing idea, we ended up<br />
    sitting in the hot sun on an inner tube floating down the delaware<br />
    river at a very leisurely pace. </p>
<p>    Then went back to his place for a bbq with his family which was a nice<br />
    little slice of American Pie. Then two of his friends, Megan and BJ,<br />
    came over and picked us up for a trip into Philli. We got to see some<br />
    awesome acts for free on the steps of the Art Museum, Bryan Adams<br />
    (stoked... not), Rufus Wainright and the real reason that I went .....<br />
    Elton John! I know I could get some shit from people about that but I<br />
    couldn't pass up the opportunity to see someone influential and<br />
    inspirational to so many people. And he was excellent! truely<br />
    sensational. </p>
<p>    Anyways, it's now Tuesday night and I've hardly slept so I shall leave you with that little peek into my birthday weekend. </p>
<p>    Ciao<br />
    Jamie<br />
