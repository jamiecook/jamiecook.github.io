<p>Well all, don't really have a lot to report this week, had a bit of a<br />
    crazy weekend last weekend (again) so this weekend I've been keeping a<br />
    bit of a low profile. We had some friends around on friday night but<br />
    apart from a lack of sleep it was pretty tame. </p>
<p>    I've been playing with my mum's new laptop for the major part of the<br />
    weekend, if you are reading this mum - you might not be getting this<br />
    thing :) Matt's TV is totally kickarse and can handle the video output<br />
    of the laptop, so I've been running my little dual screen office set up<br />
    most of the weekend. </p>
<p>    Let me explain more, right now I am typing this on the laptop LCD while<br />
    media player plays an albumn on the TV screen. Nice big visualisations<br />
    going on and sound piped through the bigger and better speakers<br />
    (compared to the laptop speakers). And last night Matt decided to check<br />
    out the latest subscription service from Rhapsody Inc. Once signed up<br />
    (free trial - normally $13/mnt), you get download access to the 300 odd<br />
    movies which are currently playing on the starx movie network FOR<br />
    DOWNLOAD!!! So last night he downloaded the chinese flick <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0299977/" title="Link outside of this blog">Hero </a>and watched it on the big TV and it looked incredible, slightly below DVD quality but not much below. </p>
<p>    The movie is pretty damn good too, not the fastest moving but<br />
    tragically epic in the traditional chinese style. The use of colour<br />
    throughout the movie was absolutely breathtaking aswell, it was<br />
    directed by Yimou Zhang (who also did "House of flying daggers") and I<br />
    have to say that I've been impressed by both offerings.</p>
<p>    Anyway thats about all from me for now, watch hero if you get a chance.</p>
