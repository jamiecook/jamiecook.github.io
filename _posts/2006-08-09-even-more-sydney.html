<p>I'm feeling like a regular Sydney-sider after yet another weekend down in our nations psuedo-capital. Gill is still down there, as she was on her Birthday poor thing, so I went down on the weekend to keep her company in a strange city. Not that she really needs the help getting about "a strange city" - she has been staying in the same hotel (I don't really call it a hotel but that is another story) each trip down there so she's spent the better part of two month this year living in Kings Cross. I've been staying with her there and it's pretty much like living in the valley here in Brisbane would be, lots of restaurants and cafes within easy walking distance (plus the nightclubs, prostitutes and sex shops). Didn't take the camera down but got one or two nice shots with the cameraphone, will post soon.</p>
