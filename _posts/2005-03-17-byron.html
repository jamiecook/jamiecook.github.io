<p><b>Days left in the country: 14</b></p>
<p>    I'm sitting at uni waiting to get picked up and go down to byron for<br />
    Liam's Great Northern gig. I've been to the pub to celebrate St.<br />
    Patricks day and now I'm off to the coast.... WooHoo!!!!!</p>
<p>    And I got my tickets today, all paid for and everything. things appear to be irrevocable.</p>
<p>    I shall post pics as soon as I have them.</p>
