<p>June 1st marks the release of the latest stable version of Ubuntu linux distribution. You can download the handy combined live CD / installer from the ubuntu <a href="http://releases.ubuntu.com/6.06/" title="Link outside of this blog">homepage</a> (scroll down for torrent files) and a handy review (which has convinced me to get dapper running on that spare machine I have at home) <a href="http://www.linuxforums.org/reviews/ubuntu_6.06_review.html" title="Link outside of this blog">here</a>.<br /><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/u-headerlogo.png" /></p>
