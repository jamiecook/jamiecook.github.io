<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jamiecook/441645775/" title="Photo Sharing"><img class="alignleft" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/441645775_149e5dc760_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Leah's first weekend at home" /></a>I've been looking forward to it for a long while and finally this weekend we visited the local RSPCA and adopted a beautiful 11 month old staffy cross rottweiler (but she has much more staffy than rotty) girl named Leah. She was given up by her previous owners because she is a jumper and 4ft fences just couldn't keep her in. So we've been busy for the rest of the weekend getting the one section of our fence that isn't 6 ft tall up to scratch.</p>
