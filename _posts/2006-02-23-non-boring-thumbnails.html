<p>Saw this little article on wired and thought I'd preserve it for when I do some more web-development. Basically it's a method for growing thumbnails into the fullsized image directly on the page - <a href="http://www.hotwired.com/webmonkey/06/08/index2a.html" title="Link outside of this blog">full description</a> or <a href="http://diverged.org/thumbnail/" title="Link outside of this blog">just a demo</a> for those of you who don't care about how it's done. </p>
<p>From the demo I could think of a couple of enhancements, namely there should only be one image full sized at a time, if you click on a second it should minimize the first one. And why does it even need to be a click - mouseover should work just as well. </p>
