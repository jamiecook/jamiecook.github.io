<p>Hey all, this is going to be real short as we are about to go and check<br />
    out the free wine tasting in the hotel lobby (score). We are currently<br />
    in San Francisco and staying in this awesome suite at a kick arse hotel<br />
    and pretty much just loving life - going to go out and explore the<br />
    streets after some wine. </p>
<p>    I'm going to write up a big trip report once I get back but for now you'll have to make do with this.</p>
<p>    J</p>
