<p>How could monday mornings be any worse than they already are I hear you ask... well gather round because I have the answer you are seeking. The extra antagonism you require can be readily supplied by your dentist and their trusty novocaine + drill combination. I am now sitting at work (at lunch time) unable to consume any food for the next few hours and gradually realising that while the novocaine works well for a few hours it gradually wears off leaving me with a growing throbbing feeling in my mouth. Joy!</p>
