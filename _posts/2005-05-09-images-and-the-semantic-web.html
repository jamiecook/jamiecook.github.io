<p>	I've also been playing with my Ubuntu linux desktop trying to find some<br />
	good photo organizing software. I came up with a couple of pretty cool pieces of software. </p>
<p>	The first I found was <a href="http://gqview.sourceforge.net/" title="Link outside of this blog">GQview</a><br />
	which seems to be a fairly solid piece of work built up from gimp. My<br />
	only complaint would be the fairly slow load time for thumbnails. At<br />
	least for the initial pass of a directory anyway, after that it caches<br />
	them which improves the situation (there is still a situation tho). It<br />
	does however seem to be one of the lightest solutions, it loads the<br />
	interface in next to no time and doesn't seem to unecessarily load down<br />
	the cpu....&nbsp; unlike our next contender. </p>
<p>	<a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/f-spot/" title="Link outside of this blog">f-spot</a> I found in<br />
	the last place I looked, no not under the cushions on the sofa, but in<br />
	the Graphics directory on my main menu. Apparently it comes pre-loaded<br />
	with Ubuntu linux. It is a bit less mature than GQview being only up to<br />
	the 0.12 version but for that it seems like an excellent piece of<br />
	software. </p>
<p>	It is based off the great (but sadly windows only) Picasa software<br />
	which is being touted (and funded?) by Google and Flickr. It doesn't<br />
	have the same level of functionality that Picassa does (hey it's only<br />
	version 0.12) but the interface seems to have been taken exactly from<br />
	the picasa drawing board. Given the overlap and quick time to product<br />
	that I'm seeing with f-spot I wouldn't rule out the possibility that<br />
	there was some contribution from the picasa developers. That is just<br />
	conjecture on my part though - don't take it too seriously. </p>
<p>	The third option I trialled was Gwenview. I was reluctant to install<br />
	this option as it is based on the KDE desktop and I am running a Gnome<br />
	desktop but I bit the bullet and installed the KDE dependencies that<br />
	gwenview required and gave it a bash. It loads a lot slower than GQview<br />
	(understandably) but once loaded is slick and loads thumbs and previews<br />
	quickly (even on this old Toshiba TE2000 Im running on). Like the<br />
	others it still has limitted support for the EXIF tags which I so<br />
	desperately want to edit. </p>
<p>	In conclusion, all are decent pieces of software but don't really come<br />
	close to the image databasing tools you can find on windows (ie adobe<br />
	photo albumn, picasa). I'm thinking I'm going to give f-spot and gqview<br />
	a bit more of a look in. I've downloaded code for the former and am<br />
	trying to get a handle on how it all fits together - kind of hard as it<br />
	is written in mono and I have no experience whatsoever in csharp. It<br />
	seems to have the best road map for getting meta data tag functionality<br />
	tho so I'll stick with it until it is more whole. </p>
<p>	In my next post I'll rant a bit more about why I want to be able to edit these tags easily.</p>
