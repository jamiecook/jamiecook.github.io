<p>As always when perusing the internet I am convinced that there are too many people out there with way too much time on their hands, a case in point are the twelve students from Oregon State who spent a great deal of time creating the firefox crop circle...</p>
<blockquote><p>Planned in under two weeks and completed in under 24 hours, the crop circle had a final diameter of 220 feet. We constructed the circle in an oat field near Amity, Oregon, where it was completely invisible from the road but unmistakable from the sky. Our team consisted of 12 people, mainly OSU students, and we carefully stomped down oats from 3:30pm Friday afternoon until 2:30am, putting on the finishing touches between 7:30am and 11:00am Saturday, August 12.</p></blockquote>
<p>At least it gives me something to giggle at while I'm waiting for my processing to finish :)</p>
