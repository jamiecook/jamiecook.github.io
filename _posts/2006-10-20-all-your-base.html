<p>I saw this piss funny comment on slashdot under the "Japan McDonalds distributes USB virus" article. This is very geeky, if you don't find this funny then you probably have a life off of the internet.</p>
<p>In A.D. 2006<br />
Meal was beginning.<br />
Customer: What happen?<br />
Slashdotter: McDonalds set up us the free mp3 player.<br />
Slashdotter: You get virus.<br />
Customer: What !<br />
Lawyer: Main bank account turn on.<br />
Customer: It's You !!<br />
Ronald McDonald: How are you gentlemen !!<br />
Ronald McDonald: All your passwords are belong to us.<br />
Ronald McDonald: You are on the way to obesity.<br />
Customer: What you say !!</p>
