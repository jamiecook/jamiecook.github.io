<p>I got one!!! Yes I am finally moving on with my life and have recently accepted a job as a developer with a consulting company in Toowong. This is big news for me as it means I will be leaving the comfy confines of the academic world to brave the harsh reality of the working world - but then after doing my PhD how hard can it really be :) I start next monday and am pretty darn excited about it all. The company I'm working for do traffic modelling and analysis - what I'll be doing for them is still a bit of a mystery but it promises to be engaging to say the least.</p>
