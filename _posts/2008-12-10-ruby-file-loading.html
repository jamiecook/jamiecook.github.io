<p>Just coz I always forget them, three good ways to load files into memory in ruby</p>
<pre>File.open(filename, 'r') do |f| f.readlines end
IO.readlines(filename).each do |line| end
lines = IO.read(filename).split("\n")
</pre>
<p>thanks to Partro for the outline along with the following three points</p>
<ul>
<li>File.open gives you a file handle you can stream from</li>
<li>while the IO methods read it all in at once</li>
<li>read gives you a single string of the contents, readlines splits it on line endings</li>
</ul>
