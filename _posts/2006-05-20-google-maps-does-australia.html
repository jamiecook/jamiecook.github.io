<p>For all those who feel as if we've been missing out on the love here down under, despair no more google maps has finally come to the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=brisbane,+australia&amp;ll=-27.44583,153.008652&amp;spn=0.004056,0.010815&amp;t=h&amp;om=1" title="Link outside of this blog">party</a>. Big props to <a href="http://cebidae.blogspot.com/" title="Link outside of this blog">cebidae </a>for breaking this one before the official google blog did. It also appears as if the database has had some extra high zoom scans added to it since the last time I checked. </p>
