<p>Super handy little piece of trickery for the research minded amongst us. If you've been using google Scholar (or looking for a reason to start using it) you might not have known that you can get it to export citations for you. Thats right, by checking the box in your scholar settings (available from any scholar page) and selecting either bibtex or endnote, every single result will have a small option allowing you to grab the citation information. As someone who has spent an inordinate amount of time maintaining a listing of citations and publications this is incredibly useful and if you do too I'd encourage you to check it out.</p>
