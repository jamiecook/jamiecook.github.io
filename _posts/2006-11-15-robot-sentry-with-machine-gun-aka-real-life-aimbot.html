<p>Designed with the South Koreans in mind, this new robo-sentry is expected to be deployed along the demilatirized zone between the north and south. Kind of scary when you think of these things being deployed with just a single spoken warning (presumably delivered in Korean) before it starts splattering you all over the countyside.</p>
<blockquote><p>Samsung has partnered with Korea university and developed the machine-gun equipped robotic sentry. It is equipped with two cameras with zooming capabilities one for day time and one for infrared night vision. It has a sophisticated pattern recognition which can detect the difference between humans and trees, and a 5.5mm machine-gun. The robot also has a speaker to warn the intruder to surrender or get a perfect headshot. The robots will go on sale by 2007 for $ 200,000 and will be deployed on the border between North and South Korea.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>It could get worse though if some off-shore programmer finds a way to detect U.S. citizens.</p></blockquote>
