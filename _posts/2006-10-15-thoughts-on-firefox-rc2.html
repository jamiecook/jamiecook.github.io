<p>Firefox is now nearing the version 2.0 milestone, with the second release candidate being released last week and <a href="http://arstechnica.com/reviews/apps/firefox2-rc2.ars">positive reviews</a> already starting to surface on the net. The development team have apparently already started focusing their efforts on the next version (3.0) and are soliciting <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org./Firefox/Feature_Brainstorming">requests for features</a>, you can even download <a href="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-trunk/">alpha builds</a> for v3.0 already if you are feeling adventurous and have no problems with stability :) .</p>
<p>I installed RC2 earlier this week and have been pretty impressed with it so far with the following exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Opening new windows in new tabs is awesome - automatically giving them focus is not!</li>
<li>Only about 40% of my extensions currently work with the new version</li>
<li>It's great that each tab has a 'close' icon on it but why did they get rid of the original x in the top right hand corner? When I have a lot of tabs that I want to close it was good to be able to repeatedly click in the same location rather than hunting for individual tabs close button</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully these issues will be resolved as more extensions update themselves to the new API.</p>
