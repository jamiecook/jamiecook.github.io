<p>If you haven't seen it yet for god's sake google "Chaser APEC" and read up on this <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/06/2026199.htm">piss</a> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/06/2025910.htm">funny</a> stunt.</p>
<blockquote><p>
The stunt involved driving a fake motorcade into the northern part of the CBD including Macquarie Street, with one of the crew dressed as Osama bin Laden.
</p></blockquote>
<p>That really sums it up nicely however there are some very funny quotes like "we picked Canada because we thought it feasible that they would only have 3 cars in their motorcade". Priceless! Not so funny however is the police reaction to this...</p>
<blockquote><p>
Mr Campbell says the situation is not funny and is being treated seriously by the APEC Investigation Squad.</p>
<p>"This is an extremely serious issue," he said.</p>
<p>"The Government has made the point time and time again, that we've got the most serious, the biggest security operation in Australia's history.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess that when your security is shown up as a joke that you've got to have someone to blame, and if you can't blame yourself you'll have to blame those that (lightheartedly) demonstrated the lack of security for all the world to see. I find this especially funny considering the incredible amount of displacement required of Sydney-siders to accomodate these politicians (and face it that is all they are).</p>
<blockquote><p>
More problems are anticipated if the stars of TV comedy The Chaser - who were denied media accreditation - manage to infiltrate security. Chaser member Julian Morrow told The Sunday Telegraph he was expecting his team to be arrested. "We want to get a working majority arrested and we want to get Chas (Licciardello) shot," he said.</p>
<p>"At this stage I think we're on target. We're hoping at least three of the team will be arrested."</p>
<p>Morrow said it was unhealthy for attending APEC politicians to be protected. "We have every right to be there," he said. "I think in principle it's a bad thing, I think the idea that politicians should be protected from scrutiny is a bad idea and that they should be protected from mockery is an even worse idea."
</p></blockquote>
<p>And I couldn't agree more, we live in a country with a (supposedly) free press, why then should such extensive measures be put in place to deny any semblance of transparency to these proceedings. I appreciate a public holiday as well as the next guy (and I don't even live in Sydney) but this has the feel of take your damn holiday and get the heck outa town!!</p>
<p>Update: And for a few more laughs check this video from Wed night, "how far are Sydney-siders willing to go to cope with APEC regulations?", I love the bit where he is stealing a girls bike and yelling "APEC!!" as he rides off on it. Just goes to show how indoctrinated we are to this security theatre, lots of people pretending to be doing something (and inconveniencing normal people in the process) while people who are actually interested in breaching security can do it with a couple of TV actors and producers... do you feel safe now?</p>
