<p>The things the US&nbsp; military <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/channel/mech-tech/dn8802.html" title="Link outside of this blog">comes up with</a>, the description paints an impressive picture and seems to be a fairly nifty autonomous vehicle - I wonder if it's max capacity (40kg) will rise in the future to a point where you could ride one of these things? It also fits in rather nicely with the little known fact (which I read on the citycat going to work the other day) that "US have never lost a war when donkeys were used" . Now that they have robot donkeys they'll be unstoppable.
