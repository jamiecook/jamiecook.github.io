<p>As with everything else in my life at the moment, this post will include references to my thesis. So to get it out the way... friday morning I got so over the thesis that I printed it out in full and handed it off to the 3rd member on my defense panel. This is apparently not the norm in our lab, normally it handed to the 3rd member a few weeks <strong>after</strong> the seminar. But I wanted a week to work on the actual presentation itself so I've decided I'm going to put thesis writing on the back burner for the next few days.</p>
<p>But anyway, back to the topic at hand after handing in the draft copy I had a very enjoyable afternoon celebrating the marriage of my friends Darren and Sally. Darren was kind enough (some might say silly enough) to get me a job working with him in the states. This was about 2 years ago now and with our busy lives on other sides of the world, the opportunities to catch up with Darren have been few and far between. So it was great to see them up there exchanging vows here in Brisbane (and kudos to you Darren for picking a church that was literally a 3 minute drive from my house). The reception was held at the Rugby Club downtown, I was a bit stumped at the choice of venue until we got there and saw the incredible view of the story bridge that they have. Spectacular.</p>
