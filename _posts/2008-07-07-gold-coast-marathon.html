<p>To celebrate my recent birthday I decided to prove I was still young and fit by taking part in the Gold Coast Marathon (in the half marathon event... I'm not quite crazy enough to run 42km yet :) The race was held yesterday in drizzly conditions down on the Gold Coast and I was very pleasantly surprised at the performance I mustered on the day. I was aiming to get around the 2 hour mark for the run but felt so good on the day that I managed to pull out the following</p>
<div align="center">
<table border="1">
<tr>
<td>No.</td>
<td>Name</td>
<td>Event</td>
<td>Cat</td>
<td>Crossed Start Mat @</td>
<td>Crossed Finish Mat @</td>
<td>Finish Time</td>
<td>Net Time

<td>08:26:23</td>
<td>01:55:39</td>
<td><strong>01:52:04</strong>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>An interesting thing to note is the difference between my net time and my finish time, 3 minutes and 35 seconds, there were so many people in the race that that is how long it took me to get from my starting position in the pack to the start line after they officially started the race. We were packed in like sardines and it didn't let up until about half way through.</p>
