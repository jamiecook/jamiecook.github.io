<p>&lt;geek&gt;<br /><a href="http://codinginparadise.org/projects/storage/README.html" title="Link outside of this blog">This looks</a> like an interesting method for storing a more significant amount of data on a client machine when developing AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML: for the uninitated it's the techonology used to develop new web applications, Google's GMail and maps.google.com among them). </p>
<p><i>The AJAX MAssive Storage System (AMASS) uses a hidden flash applet to allow<br />
    JavaScript AJAX applications to store an arbitrary amount of sophisticated information<br />
    on the client side. This information is permanent and persistent; if a<br />
    user closes their browser or navigates away from the web site, the information<br />
    is still present and can be retrieved later by the web page. Information stored<br />
    by web pages is private and locked to a single domain, so other web sites<br />
    can not access this information.</i></p>
<p>&lt;/geek&gt;</p>
