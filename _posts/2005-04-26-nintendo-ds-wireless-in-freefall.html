	Roussos writes "Wired reports about four skydivers who decided to give<br />
	the Nintendo DS wireless capabilities a try while they were<br />
	freefalling. 'The four sky divers proved that an ad hoc network set up<br />
	using the wireless functions of a Nintendo DS works perfectly at<br />
	distances of nearly 400 feet while falling 120 miles an hour,' states<br />
	the article."</p>
