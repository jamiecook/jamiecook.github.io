I found this sweet little robot on slashdot, made doubly sweet by the fact that "yes... this little fellow does run linux!!! " :)</p>
<blockquote><p>"Four companies in Japan have created a low-cost, user-programmable humanoid robot targeting educational and research applications. ... The HRP-2m Choromet stands about 14 inches tall, and is capable of walking upright on two legs. It can also assume supine or prone positions, and stand up from either."</p></blockquote>
<p>I always love seeing these developments as it means that the age of robot slaves doing our bidding is inching ever closer to reality. Of course that means that the age of our docile robot minions rising up to overthrow the brutal oppression of human kind in a blood bath of destruction is also getting closer, but hey you got to take the bad with the good right?</p>
