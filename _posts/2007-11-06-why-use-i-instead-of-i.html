<p>I knew that it was better practice to specify my for loops in c++ in the following form</p>
<p><code><br />
for (int i=0; i&lt;max_ITER; ++i)....<br />
</code></p>
<p>rather than</p>
<p><code><br />
for (int i=0; i&lt;max_ITER; i++)....<br />
</code></p>
<p>but I was unsure exactly why. The reason is that the post-fix operator requires three steps<br />
1) a copy of the current value of i is made<br />
2) the current value of i is incremented<br />
3) the copy is returned</p>
<p>Obviously this isn't a very big performance hit for simple integers but for more complicated classes where the pre/post fix operators are overloaded the second step may be a non-negligible stage and in a case such as the above for-loop counter where the value isn't being used it is an unnecessary stage. Hence it is better practice to always use the ++i form of the increment unless the value is actually being used.</p>
