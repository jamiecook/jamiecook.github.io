<p>Seasons greetings to you all. I hope everyone is having as great a Chrissie as I am, I'm back in Australia, seeing my mates, my family and enjoying some beautiful weather. I am staying with my little sister up at my mum's house on the Sunshine coast (1 1/2 hours north of Brisbane). It is now boxing day and I'm sitting down after a big lunch and watching the boxing day test match, Australia is playing South<br />
Africa and so far doing pretty well at 1/147.</p>
<p>This afternoon I'm hoping to get down the beach and then perhaps play a bit of backyard cricket with my mates. Loving life!!!!</p>
