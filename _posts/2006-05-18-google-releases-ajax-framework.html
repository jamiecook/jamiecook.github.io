<p>If like me you've been impressed with the spiffyness of the recent spate of google applications such as Gmail, Maps, Notebook etc... but don't have the faintest idea on how you could possibly make web applications to rival them then good news is at hand. Google have recently announced that they will be releasing their Google Web Toolkit <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/05/17/127214" title="Link outside of this blog">(GWT)</a> which promises to allow developers to write java code which will be auto-translated into cross-browser compatible ajax code. Neat-O!!!!</p>
