<p>I've been spending the last couple of days trying to figure out how to install mythTV on my gentoo linux box. I'd been having trouble with QT, here is a quick run down of the stages I went through:</p>
<ol>
<li>the version on my system was 3.3.3 (which is compatible) but hadn't been compiled with mysql support.</li>
<p>
<li>Simple solution was to set the appropriate flags in my /etc/portage/package.use and re-emerge the package.</p>
<pre>echo "x11-libs/qt mysql opengl" &gt;&gt; /etc/portage/package.use
emerge -1 qt</pre>
</li>
<p></p>
<li>emerge however wants to install the newest version of QT (4.1.2) which is not compatible with mythtv.</li>
<p>
<li>After a lot of searching I was finally able to come up with a solution to what is essentially a very simple problem. Turns out that emerge doesn't like the full package descriptor when specifying versions. So
<pre>emerge -1 =qt-3.3.6-r1 </pre>
<p> works, but
<pre>emerge -1 =x11-libs/qt-3.3.6-r1</pre>
<p>doesn't.</li>
<p>
<li>Also there is also a qt3 descriptor for the version 3 of QT
<pre>echo "x11-libs/qt3 mysql opengl" &gt;&gt; /etc/portage/package.use</pre>
</li>
<p></ol>
