<p>Here is a great example of the useful information that can be harvested from the plethora of metadata type information floating around the internet. The guys at <a href="http://www.Flagrantdisregard.com">Flagrantdisregard.com</a> scrapped the EXIF data from photos being uploaded onto <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr </a>and compiled a list of the top 10 camera models being used. 
<ol>
<li>Canon EOS DIGITAL REBEL XT </li>
<li>NIKON D50 </li>
<li>Canon EOS 350D DIGITAL </li>
<li><a href="http://www.logicamera.com/digital-camera-reviews/canon-eos-20d.php" class="inner_link">Canon EOS 20D</a> </li>
<li>NIKON D70 </li>
<li>NIKON D70s </li>
<li><a href="http://www.logicamera.com/digital-camera-reviews/canon-s2-is.php" class="inner_link">Canon PowerShot S2 IS</a> </li>
<li>Canon EOS 30D </li>
<li>Sony CYBERSHOT </li>
<li>Canon EOS DIGITAL REBEL</li>
</ol>
<p>It is worth noting the potentials for skew that exist in this data, but overall it can be taken as representative of digital camera enthusiasts.<br />
<blockquote>Of course, the data may be skewed, since some users might unknowingly be stripping off EXIF data from their photos before uploading to Flickr (say, if the photos were resized using an editor that didn't save the<br />
EXIF along with the resized image). Also, notice that Sony cameras are marked by “CYBERSHOT,” and not by exact model–likely, photos were taken with phone-cams.</p>
<p>Further, you will notice that the D-SLRs dominate the list. Perhaps this is due to the sheer volume that photo enthusiasts (amateur photographers and professionals) upload on their sites, which sometimes serve as their portfolios. They're likely the ones to have Pro accounts, too, which gives them unlimited upload capability. Casual users, on the other hand, might not be uploading so frequently, and would probably have free, limited accounts.</p></blockquote>
