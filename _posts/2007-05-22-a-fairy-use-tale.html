<p>I found this youtube video linked from Slashdot, appartently Disney have a fairly terrible reputation for draconian crack downs on any online material that they deem to infringe upon their copyright (even when the material would be allowed under the doctrine of fair use). This guy has cut up 10 or so Disney movies to put together a short introduction to the concepts of fair use and copyright law (as they apply in the US anyway, but with the homogenisation of Australia and US IP laws via the latest free trade agreement it might apply here aswell before too long). Also it's funny!</p>
