<p>If you are anything like me then you will at some stage have been highly addicted to the social networking site, Facebook. As I also happen to love Picasa it seemed fitting that I have someway of getting my photos from picasa up to flickr where they might actually be seen by the people in them. There are plenty of facebook apps that will allow you to show your picasa web albumns (or flickr photos) on your facebook page but <a href="http://www.infuzionweb.com/sketches/2007/11/01/picasa-facebook-plugin/">this one</a> seems to be the only picasa plugin that allows you to upload directly to your facebook albumns (with their handy person tagging functionality). All you have to do is right click and save the pbf file to</p>

C:\Program Files\Picasa2\buttons\facebook.pbf
