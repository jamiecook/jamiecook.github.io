<p>After installing wordpress on my home server I had trouble getting access from both normal internet and within my home network, the trouble being with the Network Address Translation on my router. This <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Westi/Hosting_WordPress_Behind_NAT">article </a> gives a good fix using the hosts file (which I didn't even realise existed on windows).</p>
<blockquote><p>Add the following line to your hosts file<br />
linux - /etc/hosts<br />
windows - C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts</p>
<p># if you are on the machine running the webserver<br />
127.0.0.1 localhost www.example.com<br />
# if you are on another machine in the local network<br />
192.168.0.100 www.example.com
</p></blockquote>
