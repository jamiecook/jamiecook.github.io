<blockquote>Complexity is everywhere. It's a structural and organizational<br />
principle that reaches almost every field imaginable, from genetics and<br />
social networks to food webs and stock markets. Contemporary scientific<br />
and technological accomplishments—including mapping the human<br />
genome, decoding neural networks and opening up the ocean to<br />
exploration—have seen our ability to generate and acquire<br />
information outpace our ability to make sense of it. With a surfeit of<br />
facts and few ways to synthesize them, "meaningful information" quickly<br />
becomes an oxymoron.</p></blockquote>
<p>I really was just interested in the pretty pictures part though :) They've got <a href="http://www.seedmagazine.com/news/2006/07/look_around_you.php">images of</a> neural networks from a mouse brain, the interconnecting structure of trees/leaves/branches and my favourite the "The World of Music: SDP Layout of High Dimensional Data" - this comes from Yahoo! music which I'm actually a paying member of... so I guess I helped to make some of these little interconnecting lines :)<br /><a href="http://www.seedmagazine.com/news/uploads/vcmusic800x533.jpg"><br />
