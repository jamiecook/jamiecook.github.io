<p>Had awesome sushi for dinner tonight (as the title says). First time<br />
	I've had tofu over here and it hasn't tasted like boiled plastic. </p>
<p>	Was wondering when I'd find time to go open up a bank account, when I wandered up to the cafeteria, which is in the<br />
	building I work in, and found a desk setup looking for new bank accounts. Thats right a bank wanting me to sign up for<br />
	an account... free Checking (what they call a savings account) with<br />
	free internet banking and free debit card. AND if I get my salary deposited<br />
	directly into this account (50), set up and pay some bills online (25),<br />
	use my debit card three times (25) or any combination of the previous<br />
	they will give me free cash up to $100 (50+25+25). Sweet huh and I<br />
	didn't even have to go anywhere :) </p>
