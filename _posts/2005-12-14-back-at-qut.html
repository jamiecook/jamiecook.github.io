<p>Well today is my second day back in the lab here at QUT and I've managed to get some processing running which looks like it will take quite a while. I'm not really sure what I'm going to do while I wait for it to finish so I decided to post here instead, plus I'm hoping this will stop me thinking about lunch which is still an hour away :(</p>
<p>You might have noticed that the dates on my last posts were a little misleading, I wrote the posts while flying back to Aus (coz I had nothing better to do on the flight) and posted them when I returned from my holiday... I mean work trip to Cairns :) I landed in Brisvegas on Sunday the 4th of Dec and then jumped a flight up to Cairns on the Monday for the <a href="http://dicta2005.aprs.org.au/" title="Link outside of this blog">DICTA</a> conference. I had to present two papers (one of my own and one from Sarnoff), and both presentations went well despite a lack of preparation. I have to say that the Cairns convention center provided excellent facilities for the event and really are a top notch venue, the food was good, the space was bright and airy and the staff friendly (plus free wireless internet which I enjoyed). Gill came up with me and we stayed in a decent hotel a short walk from the esplanade, which provided some great opportunities for fine dining. </p>
<p>After the conference was done, Gill and I headed out of town and South to Tully, which is a town which boasts the highest rainfall in Queensland and the largest banana plantation in the southern hemisphere. We were camped about 20km south of the town at this gorgeous camping ground right beside this incredible waterfall (Murray Falls), we took a few pics and posted them to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/jamiecook" title="Link outside of this blog">flickr </a>but here are some of the better ones. </p>

<p>It really was so peaceful up there it is hard to describe in words, just try imagining waking up in a nice shady spot to clear blue skys and hearing the sound of falling water in the background. That'l get you close to how good it is.</p>
<p>Tully also has a massive gorge behind it which has white water rapids and is enclosed by pristine rainforest. One side is a national park and the other is heritage listed rainforest. We went down with this company that does all day rafting tours, we had a funny Canadian girl steering us (and yelling at us) as we zipped down the rapids (and in one case into the rapids - but we were rescued quickly by the other boats). They stopped after a few hours and put on a great BBQ lunch, well it tasted great after all the hard yakka we'd been doing all morning anyway, then it was off for an afternoon of more paddling. Gill and I both ended up with real bad sunburn on our knees (as did most everyone else) and I had a cracker of a burn line from my sandals. But all in all we would do it all over again in a heartbeat, that pretty much seemed to be the buzz from other rafters in the pub afterwards too :)</p>
<p>Well those are my adventures in getting back into Australia I've got more stories from my mate Liam's birthday / my return party which I shall post shortly (complete with photo evidence). </p>
