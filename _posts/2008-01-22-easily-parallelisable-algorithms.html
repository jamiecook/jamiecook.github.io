<p>Currently putting together a little demonstration to show off the power of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=201590011">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</a> (EC2) and I'm looking for an algorithm to<br />
demonstrate that benefits well from parallelization. The requirements are that:</p>
<p>* We can generate input data in a reasonable time (either randomly or systematically)<br />
* Input and output are reasonably sized (ie Less than 1Gb)<br />
* Parallelization will occur at the machine level rather than processor or thread level<br />
* Example will run for about 20 minutes on a single core laptop<br />
* We are hoping to get a 10 node machine up and running and get the parallel version run in less than 5 minutes.</p>
<p>If you have any suggestions for such would love to hear about in the comments or via email jamie at ieee period org :)</p>
