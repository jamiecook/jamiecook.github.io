<p>A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build<br />a<br />
    wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders,<br />
    cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch<br />
    manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die<br />
    gallantly. Specialization is for insects.</p>
<p>    &nbsp; --- Robert Heinlein</p>
