<p>If you are running firefox as your primary web-browser you'll probably be familiar with the Mozilla Foundation who look after firefox distribution. You might also have potentially shortened their name to the unlikely MoFo - hilarious!!</p>
<p>But not so funny as the legal firm Morrison &amp; Foerster which share the unlikely abbrieviation (<a href="http://www.mofo.com" title="Link outside of this blog">www.mofo.com</a>). This gets even funnier when you run across one of the internal press releases which reads (and I kid you not) "<a href="http://www.mofo.com/news/media/files/pr559.html" title="Link outside of this blog">MoFo One of 100 Best Companies for Working Mothers</a>". Absolutely side splitting - at least to a dirty minded individual such as myself.&nbsp;</p>
