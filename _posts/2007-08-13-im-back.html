<p>I am back from my trip into limbo with many exciting stories and pictures to share with you... actually limbo was pretty boring come to think of it... all grey and not much else :) The good news is that my home server is back up and running better than ever and wordpress has been upgraded to it's super dooper latest version.</p>
<p>What have I been upto? well... first let me give you my thesis update.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Status: SUBMITTED!!! </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>You heard right, my years of hard work are finally coming to fruition with the submission of my thesis for external review. It's been in for about a month now and I've been loving life since getting rid of it. I've been going to the gym and yoga, sleeping in, playing with the dog, getting work done on my garden and (eventually) on my server. All very relaxing, also I went down to splendour in the grass but that is a whole other post!</p>
