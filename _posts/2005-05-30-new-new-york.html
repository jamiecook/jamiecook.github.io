<p>I'm am now back in Jersey again after another fun weekend in NY staying<br />
	with friend Jason. This time Darren and his fiancee Sally came along<br />
	and we all kicked about together - we went to a broadway show on<br />
	Saturday night which was really good fun. We saw Chitty-chitty bang<br />
	bang and I paid $8 for half a small plastic cup of wine - ah the joy of<br />
	playing in manhattan :)</p>
<p>	Today we went to the pallisades mall which is apparently the second<br />
	biggest in the states, bought a jumbo pack of razor blades (at a great<br />
	deal less than the $5 a blade you normally pay) and picked up a new<br />
	shirt. Loving consumer life.</p>
<p>	No photos this time as I left my camera at home but I think last week<br />
	was enough photos of NY anyway. Hope you all have a great week, I dont<br />
	seem to be able to post much during the week (mainly because I don't do<br />
	much during the week - except complain about work).</p>
<p>	Ciao</p>
