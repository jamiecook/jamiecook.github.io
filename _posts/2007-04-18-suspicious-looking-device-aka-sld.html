<p><a href="http://junkfunnel.com/sld/" title="SLD"><img class="alignright" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/sld_small.jpg" alt="SLD" /></a>Just found <a href="http://junkfunnel.com/sld/">this </a>in a random comment on slashdot, piss funny. The thing just sits there and looks dodgy, but it has a sensor built into the handle so that when you try to pick it up, it starts some motors attached to wheels underneath and it trys to roll away from you!! How amusing would it be to leave one of these things in an airport and watch the mayhem ensue? It'd be expensive though as I don't think you'd ever be getting it back, and probably not good to ask for it back either :)</p>
<blockquote><p>The only function of the Suspicious Looking device is to appear as suspicious as possible, whether carried in hand or placed indiscrimately in public places. The SLD contains LEDs, a LED array, a character display, an optical distance sensor, capacitive touch sensor, buzzer, and motors.
