<p>Have been interested in these for a long time and had most of one<br />
	built. But the inability to get legal access to the TV show times (in<br />
	Australia the networks retain all rights to Timetabling information)<br />
	and the frying of my video card put it on the back burner. </p>
<p>	Since I've been in the US tho, we have a PVR built right into our cable<br />
	box and we can do things like time-shift tv and easily schedule<br />
	recordings - I LOVE IT!!! I'll be spending a bit of time and <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1558,1814896,00.asp" title="Link outside of this blog">building one</a> when I get home for sure. </p>
