<p>Well perhaps not, depending on how old it is it could already have Ununoctium marked in down the bottom at position 118. <i><br /></i><br />
<blockquote><i>"The heaviest element yet, <a href="http://physicsbuzz.blogspot.com/2006/10/controversy-plagued-element-118.html">Element 118, has been created</a> in Dubna, Russia by a collaboration of researchers from Russia's Joint Institute for Nuclear Research and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the US. They created the new element by fusing together Californium (element 98) and Calcium atoms. The achievement comes five years after the scandal-plagued <a href="http://enews.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/118-retraction.html">retraction of an earlier claim</a>, which was based on fabricated data, that three atoms of element 118 had been produced at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. The achievement was <a href="http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=PRVCAN000074000004044602000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=yes">reported</a> on October 9 in the journal Physical Review C (subscription needed to read more than the abstract)."<br /></i></p></blockquote>
<p>Unfortunatly, the process for combining <a href="http://slashdot.org/%7Ewalt-sjc/">Californium and Calcium</a> (which is called "Californication") has already been patented by the Red Hot Chili Peppers.</p>
