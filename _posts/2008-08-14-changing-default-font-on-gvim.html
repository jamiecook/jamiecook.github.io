<p>I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to do it until I came across this web site: http://www.troubleshooters.com/linux/vifont.htm<br />
Considering that it is GRAPHICAL vim and there is a graphical selection of the font/size/etc, you'd think they'd have an option for saving the settings you choose right? Wrong, instead after selecting the font you like, issue the command</p>
<pre>
:set gfm?
</pre>
<p>which returns something like</p>
<pre>
guifont=Nimbus Mono L 16
</pre>
<p>then edit your ~/.vimrc (creating it if it doesn't exist) and add the following line (dont forget to escape the spaces)</p>
<pre>
set gfn=Nimbus\\ Mono\\ L\\ 16
</pre>
