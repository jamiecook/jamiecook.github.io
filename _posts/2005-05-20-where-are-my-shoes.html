<div align="left">Apparently there was a massive hail<br />
	storm in Brisbane last night. The above is not something that you get<br />
	used to seeing in Brisbane. The following was taken in Toowong, which<br />
	until recently pretty much where I slept every night. Gill told me that<br />
	people were getting stuck in the slush at the bottom of the hill near<br />
	our apartment. Just freaky - I never saw anything like it the entire<br />
	time I lived in Brisbane.</p>
