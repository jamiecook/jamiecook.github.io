<p>Well the new year is upon us and it has taken me this long to get around to posting up my first message of 2006. Lots has been happening since the last time I posted so I'll go over them all real quick. </p>
<p>First up I got real sick just after christmas and had to spend two days in bed which wasn't exactly how I had imagined my holidays and I was in doubt about whether I'd be in a fit state to go up to woodford. However I got better in time for Gll's arrival on the coast and we were able to leave for the festival the next day. It was stinking hot up there as normal and we were all very glad that my friend Liam and little brother Gareth had already set up a kick ass camp site for us to slot into. We spent a great three days up there checking out all the cool bands and work shops - Gill and I did an etheopian dancing workshop which left our calves burning for days afterwards. </p>
<p>I've got a couple of photos this year, but for the most part I was thinking more about the festival and less about photos. </p>

<p>After woodford I just sort of bummed around the house for a couple of days getting things set up around the place. Got a new wireless router and spent an afternoon setting that up to work with my adsl modem. Not as much fun as the time up in woodford for some, but for me a worthy diversion of my time :)</p>
<p>While I'm in a picture posting mode I'll also post a couple from my homecoming party (also Liam's birthday). We had it on the Sunday after we got back from Cairns and had a really awesome night, my friend Leah was in town from Melbourne and we got to have a good catch up. Played charades for about 2 hours and drank like fish, good times.

<p>Liam's friend Sarah baked him this awesome guitar cake which he proceeded to eat like he was jimi hendrix.
