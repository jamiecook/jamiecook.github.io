<p>I saw an article a while back that detailed a cop cruiser in LA using a new Licence Plate Recognition system which was capable of reading in 30-60 plates a second and sending them through the cars data system to check for outstanding warrants, stolen vehicles, parking tickets etc. Sounded like a great use of technology to imporove law enforcement - however <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,71436-0.html?tw=rss.index">this story</a> in Wired magazine gives a different perspective on the technology, in particular what happens when the price drops to a level where your local supermarket chain can install these things in their carparks?</p>
<blockquote><p>In recent years, police around the country have started to use powerful infrared cameras to read plates and catch carjackers and ticket scofflaws. But the technology will soon migrate into the private sector, and morph into a tool for tracking individual motorists' movements, says former policeman Andy Bucholz, who's on the board of Virginia-based G2 Tactics, a manufacturer of the technology.</p>
<p>Giant data-tracking firms such as ChoicePoint, Accurint and Acxiom already collect detailed personal and financial information on millions of Americans. Once they discover how lucrative it is to know where a person goes between the supermarket, for example, and the strip club, the LPR industry could explode, says Bucholz.</p>
<p>Privacy advocates worry that Bucholz, who wants to sell LPR data to consumer data brokers like ChoicePoint, knows what he's talking about.</p></blockquote>
