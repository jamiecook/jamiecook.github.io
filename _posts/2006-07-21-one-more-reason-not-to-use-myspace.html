<p>An advertisement running on the myspace website (and other sites) has apparently infected more than a million computers with spyware. These users didn't have to do anything more than browse the site using an unpatched version of windows for the spyware to install itself.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Internet Explorer users who visited a Web page containing this ad and whose IE was not equipped with the WMF patch would not get that warning. Rather, their machines would silently download a Trojan horse program that installs junk software in the PurityScan/ClickSpring family of adware. This stuff bombards the user with pop-up ads and tracks their Web usage.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I'll take this opportunity to point out the awesome <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1865/">adblock extension</a> for <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">firefox </a>with which I very rarely have to endure the displeasure of these flash laden epilepsy inducing ads.</p>
