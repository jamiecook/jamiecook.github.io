<p>In case it's not obvious, I'm doing some work with boost today upgrading from 1.34.1 -&gt; 1.42.0. I just came across this following error while running my tests</p>
<p>&lt;pre&gt;C:\projects\svn\bdk\ot51&gt;ZenithBase_test.exe --report_level=yes<br />
Test setup error: invalid report level yes&lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>Thats funny because 'yes' used to be a valid option and I can't see what they've changed it to or even what the possible options are anywhere on the internet... so I decided to put them down here based on my digging through the source:</p>
<p>* confirm - CONFIRMATION_REPORT,<br />
* short - SHORT_REPORT,<br />
* detailed - DETAILED_REPORT,<br />
* no - NO_REPORT</p>
