<p><img alt="Screens showing the analyzed EEG and the progression of the neural signatures reflective of the recognition event. " src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/brain1_f.jpg" style="padding-right:10px;" align="left" width="30%" />A really interesting concept, <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/medtech/0,71364-0.html?tw=rss.index#">these researchers</a> over at Columbia University are working on image processing algorithms that harness the power of the human visual processing to perform activity detection.</p>
<blockquote><p>The brain emits a signal as soon as it sees something interesting, and that "aha" signal can be detected by an electroencephalogram, or EEG cap. While users sift through streaming images or video footage, the technology tags the images that elicit a signal, and ranks them in order of the strength of the neural signatures. Afterwards, the user can examine only the information that their brains identified as important, instead of wading through thousands of images.

<p>This research was funded by DARPA in order to help operatives sort through reams of image data quickly, however I can see the results being extremely useful in identifying the areas in which current computer vision systems are currently lacking.</p>
