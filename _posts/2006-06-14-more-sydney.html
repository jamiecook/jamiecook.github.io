<p>Been having a chill out day today. Gill has been at work teaching kids whatever it is that she teaches them so I have been left to my own devices, that means wandering around downtown Sydney and drinking coffee in a variety of locales. It is now 3:30 in the afternoon so I though I'd take a few minutes to catch up on my web reading and blogging. Geez you leave the internet for 4 days and suddenly you have over 250 new articles collected in your intray, will have to spend a large portion of my day when I get home going through them all... no way I'm going to get it all sorted while I'm paying $3/hr for internet access.</p>
<p>Been lamenting my lack of reading material while I've been down here and this morning decided to pick up a copy of L. Ron Hubbards "<a title="Link outside of this blog" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/sitbv3/reader/ref=sib_dp_pt/103-1602716-8961407?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;asin=1592120229#reader-link">The Invasion Plan</a>" from the "Mission Earth" series. Hubbard is an author who has been recommended to me on any number of occasions by fans who are bigger into the Sci-Fi genre than I am so I have finally decided to give the guy a go, but as you can see from the below cover it doesn't exactly look like the greatest literary accomplishment of the modern age. I esp dislike the red italicized font used for "Mission Earth" - super tacky. But from the first 50 or so pages that I've read it appears to be a decent read - only nine books in the series so I'll have a full review for you all in a week - j/k.</p>

<p>Well now I am off to do some quick last minute surfing before my time runs out then off for some spannish tapas with Gill for my last night in town back in Brisbane tomorrow morning.</p>
