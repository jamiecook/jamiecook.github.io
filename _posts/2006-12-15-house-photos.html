We've agreed on a contract on a house in Coorparoo and are expecting to settle on it around mid-January. Today however I have some photos from our recent foray during the building and pest inspection.<br />

As you can see from the first photo, the block is fairly leafy and it's set in a little side street (but not too far from a main drag with lots of eateries and shopping and transport). Most importantly though, it has a big old back deck which is nicely shaded by the macadamia tree from next door. The current tenants have a sofa and BBQ and punching bag out there at the moment and it doesn't feel crowded at all.<br />

The interior is all nice and pretty, the floors are bare pine boards and will come up a treat with a polish. The living area is big enough for us and once we knock down the wall between the kitchen and the living room it'll have a nice open feel to it all, with the living moving to kitchen moving to rear deck. Two of the bedrooms have A/C and the third has french doors opening onto the deck, not bad for a current student I don't think :)</p>
