<p>I was having a bit of a problem with Visual Studio and some code that I was working with, the author had used exceptions as a flow control mechanism for a properties object. If the object did not have a value for a given key it would throw an exception which he would then catch and replace with a default value. This led to some pain when I was looking to catch exceptions in the main body of code. If I turned c++ runtime exception catching on</p>
<p> Debug -&gt; Exceptions -&gt; C++ Exceptions</p>
<p>then it would give a pop up [break/continue/ignore] for each time this particular mechanism was called. Many many button clicks before getting to the main problem. Then a co-worker put me on to the following. Open up the c++ exceptions branch and click the add button, add the exception that you would like excluded, then when it pops up untick it. Simple!</p>
