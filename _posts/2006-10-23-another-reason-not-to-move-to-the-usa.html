<blockquote><p>THE United States has slapped a ban on Vegemite, outraging Australian expatriates there.<br />The bizarre crackdown was prompted because Vegemite contains folate, which in the US can be added only to breads and cereals.</p>
<p>Expatriates say that enforcement of the ban has been stepped up recently and is ruining lifelong traditions of having Vegemite on toast for breakfast.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't know how this can be construed as anything other than a dig at Aussie ex-pats, as no American I know can stomach vegemite.</p>
<p><strong>update</strong>: AUSTRALIANS travelling to the US <a href="http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,20641599-1702,00.html">can breathe easy</a>. So can the 100,000 or so Australian expatriates living in America. The US government today dismissed media reports it had banned Vegemite.</p>
