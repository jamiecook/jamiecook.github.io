<p>I recently had a journal article I wrote accepted into the <a href="http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/tifs.html">IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security</a> which makes me a very happy chappy. The article is titled "Multi-Scale Representation for 3D Face Recognition" and the pdf is up on the publications page (just up the top there).</p>
<p>Oh and I've cracked 100 pages on my thesis!!!! Well it's a 103 page document anyways, 85 numbered pages the rest being things like title page and table of content... so I guess I'm about half way there, still things like literature review to do aswell which will bulk it right out :)</p>
