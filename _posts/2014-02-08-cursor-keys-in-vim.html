<p>So I've been meaning to post more often for a while so to get myself back in the blogging mindset here is what I'm experimenting with today. I've been doing a lot more work in vim lately thanks to some encouragement from @nkpart and one of things I find myself still doing a lot is using the cursor keys to navigate, especially when I'm in edit mode... but not anymore thanks to this little gem from https://chris-lamb.co.uk/posts/kicking-vim-cursor-key-habit</p>
<p>[code]<br />
&quot; Unbind the cursor keys in insert, normal and visual modes.<br />
for prefix in ['i', 'n', 'v']<br />
   for key in ['', '', '', '']<br />
     exe prefix . &quot;noremap &quot; . key . &quot; &quot;<br />
   endfor<br />
endfor<br />
[/code]</p>
