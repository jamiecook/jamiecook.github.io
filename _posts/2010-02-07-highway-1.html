<p>After leaving our LA hotel we picked up our hire car and I got a crash course (not literally) in driving on the wrong side of the road as I navigated us out onto highway 1 via the LA freeway system and Santa Monica. We decided to take 3 nights driving up the coast and stayed at San Luis Obispo (SLO), Monterrey and Napa Valley respectively. SLO is a sleepy little college town where we were able to check out a spanish mission from the 1700's and monterrey had the most amazing wildlife and we saw Lion Seals clustered for mating season on the beach at San Simeon. Napa was really expensive but we found the time and money to go and visit two wineries during our stay, one of which was perched on a hill with superb views out over the valley.</p>
