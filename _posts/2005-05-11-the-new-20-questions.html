<p><a href="http://y.20q.net/" title="Link outside of this blog">This</a> is pretty nifty, it guessed my<br />
	'microwave' in 19 guesses even though it disagreed with me on whether<br />
	or not a microwave gets hot. I say no - the food inside it does but the<br />
	microwave itself does not, but it guessed it anyway.</p>
