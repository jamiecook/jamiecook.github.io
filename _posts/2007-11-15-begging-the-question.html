<p>I heard someone else using the phrase incorrectly again today and I thought I'd take the time to write up a short description of the bastardisation of the phrase that has occured over the last 20 years. In logic, the term 'begging the question' refers to the predication of the premise of an argument upon the conclusion being true. It is translated from Latin <em>Petitio Principii</em> (petitio: seeking, petition, request; principii, genitive of principium: beginning, basis, premise of an argument), literally means "a request for the beginning or premise", that is, the premise depends on the truth of the very matter in question.</p>
<p>For example</p>
<ul>
<li>If such actions were not illegal, then they would not be prohibited by the law.</li>
<li>The belief in God is universal. After all, everyone believes in God.</li>
</ul>
<p>More recently, "begs the question" has been widely used as an equivalent to "invites the question," "prompts the question," "raises the question," or to indicate that "the question ought to be addressed." In this usage, "the question" is stated in the next phrase. For example: "This year's budget deficit is half a trillion dollars. This begs the question: how are we ever going to balance the budget?" I had always thought that this was the correct meaning of the phrase, however after doing some reading about the correct meaning I was talking to my mum and she couldn't believe that they weren't teaching such basic things in school these days :)</p>
