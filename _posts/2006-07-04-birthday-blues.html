<p>Well it is the week after my birthday, 1st July for those interested, and starting to feel the let down after such an awesome weekend. You know what I'm talking about, we've all had it before you go somewhere, do something that is so much fun that the following week being at work just seems that much more boring and monotonous than normal - I'm calling it the After-Birthday-Blues.</p>
<p>So what exactly was so exciting about my birthday to bring on such a slump after the fact. Well it wasn't so much a specific event which made the weekend for me, rather a series of events which together form my ideal celebration of clinging to life for another year. At the end of last week I was house sitting for mum on the sunshine coast, this involved raiding her pantry and playing with her dogs (who I don't get to see half often enough). Gill and I left that on Sat morning (B-Day) to have brunch with Liam and my sister Becky at a popular little cafe in Paddington - that left enough time in the afternoon to open up and plug in my presents (pretty much all of the electronic gadget variety) before heading out to dinner with Sam and Dylan. All in all a pretty good day.</p>
<p>Sunday was then taken up with chilling out in the valley watching Liam play a benefit gig in the Troubadour. This is a much more pleasant venue now thanks to a new law - which I like to think was a personal present from Queensland to me - which stops people from smoking anywhere that food or drink are served, inside or out!!!! Especially with small (and poorly ventilated) venues like the Troub this makes a huge difference in atmosphere, my self imposed ban on the Troub is now at an end :)</p>
