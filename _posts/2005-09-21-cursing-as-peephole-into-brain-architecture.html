<p>The New York Times offers this excellent and<br />
    entertaining writeup on cursing and its role in recent studies of the<br />
    brain. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/20/science/20curs.html?ei=5088&amp;en=aa9497f028be8281&amp;ex=1284868800&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;adxnnlx=1127275760-HdgayT2ebqQh9WJLh1ImQw" title="Link outside of this blog">The article</a> discusses the universality of cursing across time,<br />
    space, and culture, its varied roles, from linguistic evolution to<br />
    anger management, and its uses in recent brain research. You can also<br />
    read all about the sexual effects of uttering obscenities and the<br />
    swearing habits of sorority women." From the article: "Researchers<br />
    point out that cursing is often an amalgam of raw, spontaneous feeling<br />
    and targeted, gimlet-eyed cunning. When one person curses at another,<br />
    they say, the curser rarely spews obscenities and insults at random,<br />
    but rather will assess the object of his wrath, and adjust the content<br />
    of the 'uncontrollable' outburst accordingly." As someone who plays a<br />
    lot of MMOGs, in my experience this is only mostly true.</p>
