<p>I was reading a post about a new feature in Visual Studio 2010 that would allow for syntax like this for shared_ptr</p>
<p>[sourcecode language="cpp" light="true"]<br />
auto sp = make_shared&lt;T&gt;(args)<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>and I thought there should already be something like that in boost; turns out there was and I just wasn't using it. So I'm posting an example of how this can make your code a bit cleaner and neater; below is a before and after</p>
<p>[sourcecode language="cpp" light="false"]<br />
tuple&lt;int,int,int,int&gt; key = make_tuple(stopNrA, stopNrB, transitLineNr, time);<br />
if (!hasElement(m_routeSegments, key))<br />
  m_routeSegments[key] = shared_ptr(new RouteSegment(param1, param2));<br />
return m_routeSegments[key];<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>and then after using make_shared and auto</p>
<p>[sourcecode language="cpp" light="false"]<br />
auto key = make_tuple(stopNrA, stopNrB, transitLineNr, time);<br />
if (!hasElement(m_routeSegments, key))<br />
  m_routeSegments[key] = make_shared&lt;RouteSegment&gt;(param1, param2);<br />
return m_routeSegments[key];<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>The differences aren't huge but it's easy to see how things like the typing of a temporary key value and the boiler plate of constructing an object and then passing it to the constructor of a shared_ptr can unnecessarily clutter code making it less readable.</p>
