<p>Well for those of you following the trials and tribulations of a 2 hour<br />
	commute each day, good news is at hand. I think I have just found my<br />
	new apartment!!!! </p>
<p>	I went over there tonight after work and the guy is nice, he's an IT<br />
	graduate so we should get along well. Place is decently size and<br />
	moderately priced, he even took 100 off the price because I asked<br />
	nicely. </p>
<p>	It's second story with a back deck that looks out over a lake (awesome<br />
	for summer), it's close to work (&lt; 2 miles) and I even get my own<br />
	bathroom (score). There is no living room furniture yet but my bedroom<br />
	has a bed and the living room HAS A MASSIVE PLASMA TV AND X-BOX!!!!</p>
<p>	I'm in heaven! Should be moving in on Sunday, I'm going to take Darren<br />
	and Sally out for dinner tomorrow for being such sports and putting up<br />
	with me for so long. </p>
<p>	Anyways off to bed before getting up at 5:30 again tomorrow (hopefully for the last time)</p>
