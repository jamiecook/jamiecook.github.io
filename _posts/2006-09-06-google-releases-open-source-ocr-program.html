<p>Just saw this over at slashdot and felt it had to go up here - as you've probably guessed, I'm a big google fan and I think it's great to see these types of software moving into the public domain. Given the amount of work and research that has gone into character recognition there is no reason that cheap solutions for document scanning shouldn't have been available for a long time. I can't wait for more pattern recognition code to be released into the wild.<br />
<blockquote><i>"Google recently released <a href="http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2006/08/announcing-tesseract-ocr.html">Tesseract as open source</a>. Originally developed at the HP Labs from 1985-1995, it has been touted as one of the most accurate Optical Character Recognition (OCR) programs available. Having sat on the shelf gathering dust for so many years, Google cleaned up some of the more outdated portions of the code and released it for general consumption. You can <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tesseract-ocr">download Tesseract</a> over at Sourceforge.</i></p></blockquote>
