<p>Further to my previous post on compilation issues for matlab under Fedora Core 5, I found out that after getting my machine into a state where it was possible to perform the compilation, some bastard had come along and nicked the school's one and only floating license for the Matlab Compiler... GRRR!!</p>
<pre>
License Manager Error -4.
Maximum number of users for Compiler reached.
Try again later.
To see a list of current users use the lmstat utility.
</pre>
<p>I called up the very uninformative techie who deals with this sort of stuff and was unable to get a straight answer on whether it was my crashed session of Matlab that had stolen the license or if someone else had nipped in and grabbed it while I was upgrading from R14 to R2006a. So I had to go and figure it out for myself. Turns out the lmstat utility doesn't get automatically installed on linux systems and on windows systems only exists as a switch to another command. So the upshoot is if you want to know 'who has the licence for matlab toolbox X?' you had better have a windows installation around.</p>
<pre>cd \bin\win32\
lmutil lmstat -c c:\MATLAB6p5\bin\win32\license.dat -a &gt; licence.snapshot
</pre>
<p>Then just have a root around in that file for the appropriate toolbox.</p>
<pre>
