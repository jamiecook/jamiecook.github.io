<p>This kind of <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/02/18/miller_hunts_down_pe.html" title="Link outside of this blog">freaks me out</a> and annoys me at the same time. Miller (the makers of the terrible American beer - no offence Chris) have tracked down a person who used a throwaway email address to enter a competition and automatically started to send email to their main email address. </p>
<p><a name="025579" title="Link to another page in this blog">"<i>Thank you for being a loyal<br />
    consumer of Miller Brewing Company. As one of our VIP consumers, you<br />
    have likely received email communications from us in the past.<br />
    Recently, however, we have not been able to deliver email messages to<br />
    the address you originally supplied.<br />
    We have performed an electronic change of address to update our records<br />
    so that we can continue to send you special offers, promotions, and<br />
    announcements via email.</i>"</a></p>
