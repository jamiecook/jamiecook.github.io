<p>Last night we had a great farewell party, starting out with dinner at a Mexican restaurant and then moving back to our apartment. In attendance were Tesh, Maite, Matt Hopkins, Aveek, Ryan, Joy, Zina, Chris, Megan, Summer, Matt Pancione and Kristin. A few more people (Kacey, Jim) turned up after we got back from the restaurant and it was really sweet to have a good chance to mix with everyone before I flew out. Chris even bullied everyone into saying something nice about me, it was such a great moment and is something that I am going to remember for a long time (also Maite got it on video). It really made me feel special and it also made me realize how much I�m going to miss everyone when I get back home. Lots of love to you guys if you are reading this now!</p>
<p>I won�t go into the sordid details of the rest of the night but there were some shenanigans back at our favourite local the Ivy. It was&lt; totally dead and we brought the party with us, the owner giving us free shots of Jagermeister all night helped to get the party started as well. He also gave me that last Ivy t-shirt as well which will be something to reminisce about when I get home. Matt tried to buy one for me as a going away present earlier but they had sold out of them and only had the display one hanging behind the bar � which thanks to Rich I am now the proud owner of <font face="Wingdings">J</font>.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who came out to make it such a memorable night.</p>
