<p>If you noticed the extended period that this website was offline for I heartily apologize. Thankfully the number of people who were holding their breath waiting for it to come back up can probably be quantified only with a new branch of quantum mechanics so I think I'm pretty right :)</p>
<p>The outage was caused by our recent move to new digs, and the corresponding relocation of our ADSL service. But I am happy to announce that everything is now set up the way I want it with approximately 5Mb/sec downloads, and if you are reading this page you know that the upload speed is sufficient for the small tasks I ask of it.</p>
<p>Well, more news and such once I'm used to posting again.</p>
