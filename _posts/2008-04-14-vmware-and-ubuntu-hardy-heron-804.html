<p>I didn't think it was going to be possible but <a href="http://whocares.de/2008/02/25/running-vmware-server-console-on-ubuntu-hardy/">this guy</a> found a way for me to at least get the server console running so that I can connect to my machine at work!!</p>
<p>Basically the solution was to move vmware versions of libgcc and libpng out of the way</p>
<pre>
cd /usr/lib/vmware-server-console/lib/libgcc_s.so.1
mv libgcc_s.so.1 libgcc_s.so.1.org
cd ../libpng12.so.0
mv libpng12.so.0 libpng12.so.0.org
</pre>
