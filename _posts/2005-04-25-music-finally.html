<p>Well it took most of the weekend, not counting the time I spent in at<br />
	work, to get it working but it is up and running. What am I talking<br />
	about you might ask, why my personal music server streaming out music<br />
	to all comers! Well those comers who are on our wireless network<br />
	anyway. My flatmate has this cool little device which will access<br />
	content on a server (my laptop) and play it out through the stereo. It<br />
	is currently playing through the TV but it still sounds a whole better<br />
	than playing out of my laptop speakers.</p>
<p>	I went out with my flatmate and his girlfriend to some of the local<br />
	bars in Princeton. We had a great time drinking shots of Jagermeister<br />
	and playing darts, it was nice to get out of the house. I haven't<br />
	really done anything much since I been here in the US mainly due to a<br />
	lack of knowing anyone who is not also an engineer. </p>
<p>	I had to pay for it this morning tho when my boss called me in to work.<br />
	He went out and bought us lunch though which was a nice change.<br />
	Apparently my fortune cookie thinks I have the beginnings of a gambling<br />
	problem and was so kind as to warn me from straying down that path.<br />
	Thank god for that :)</p>
<p>	I'm thinking of buying myself one of the HD based audio players out there but am having trouble deciding. The <a href="http://www.sonystyle.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/eCS/Store/en/-/USD/SY_BrowseCatalog-Start;sid=tF4T5uoPhWMT8qhj1NYZ7aUAgfdynCogSLk=?CategoryName=pr_p_120value_pa&amp;Dept=audio&amp;INT=style-NWHD3SILKIT-specoffer-pr_p_120value_pa" title="Link outside of this blog">sony players</a><br />
	look awesome but I've heard bad things about the bundled software (for<br />
	which there is no alternative and no linux substitute - kind of an<br />
	issue as I hate having to boot into windows). There is of course always<br />
	the Ipod but the battery life is about half that of the sony offering<br />
	albeit with 3 times the storage. </p>
<p>	Matt also mentioned these <a href="http://www.sonystyle.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/eCS/Store/en/-/USD/SY_DisplayProductInformation-Start?ProductSKU=NWE407&amp;Dept=audio&amp;CategoryName=pa_flashMemory" title="Link outside of this blog">tidy little players</a>, 1 Gb, FM radio and 50 hours of play time.... only $200 and all in the size of a stick of gum.</p>
