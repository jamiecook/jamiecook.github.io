<p><font size="3">Man is the only animal that laughs and weeps, for he is<br />
    the only animal that is struck with the difference between what things<br />
    are and what they ought to be.<br />&nbsp; - <a href="http://www.quotationspage.com/quotes/William_Hazlitt" title="Link outside of this blog">William Hazlitt</a></font></p>
