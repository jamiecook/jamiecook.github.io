<p>A nice discussion on the past and present state of Instant Messaging and of googles new foray into the field.</p>
<p>    <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/nugget/97081.html" title="Link outside of this blog">On google talk, I apparently talk a lot</a></p>
<p>    It's almost impossible not to paint the comparison between this week's<br />
    Google Talk announcement and Google's deft grab of web mail last year,<br />
    dragging it kicking and screaming from the slums of the net. Google<br />
    polished up webmail and turned it into a first-class net citizen</p>
