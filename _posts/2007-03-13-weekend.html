That is them all over there on the left. Then we got up early the next morning to go have brekkie with our friend Josie over at west end. Her boy friend Tim lives just around the corner from our new place and they dropped by later that afternoon with their dog Monty to drop some books off. All in all it really made me want to get a dog of my own, but alas there are still 2 more weeks before Becky gets back from holiday, but as soon as she does we are off to the pound / RSPCA to pick up some poor abandoned mutt :)</p>
