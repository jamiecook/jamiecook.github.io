<p>I'm a sucker for <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060411-6577.html" title="Link outside of this blog">new google </a>products and it looks (at least to me) like this one has some great potential. Google has been trying to crack into the localalised search market with their local offering in NY which will serve up local pizzerias from appropriately enabled mobile phones and with their new positional tracking system in San Francisco where they are teaming up with Earthlink to provide free WiFi internet to the city. </p>
<p>I think that if they are able to put together a good interface (something they are renowned for) for this it could really drive adoption of google search as an application thought of synonmously with mobile phones. </p>
