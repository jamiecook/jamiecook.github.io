<p>Just been reading up on <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/tail_pr.html" title="Link outside of this blog">this very informative article</a> about the current changes in consumer behavoiur which are set to revampt the current distribution models employed by media outlets from music/movies through to books. </p>
<p>"<i>More than half of amazon's book sales came from outside the 130,000 titles which are traditionally stocked in any brick-and-mortar book seller such as Barnes and Noble"</i></p>
