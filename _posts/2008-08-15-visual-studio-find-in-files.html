<p>So a number of times I've found that Visual Studio 2005's find utility is borked. You know how it goes you press Ctrl-Shift-F and expect it to search through your solution looking for that little snippet of code you know you've written before and suddenly you get</p>
<pre>
Find all "vector\", Match case, Subfolders, Find Results 1, "Entire Solution"
No files were found to look in.
Find was stopped in progress.
</pre>
<p>what? Turns out the solution is to use the little known short cut "Ctrl+Scroll Lock", the only purpose of which is to toggle the usability of the find function, press it once and it's borked, press it again and it works. Magic!</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> Also sometimes when the above doesn't work you can press ALT + Break.... sigh</p>
