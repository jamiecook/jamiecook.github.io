<p>If you've been using Linux (or CVS) for any length of time you'll probably be fairly familiar with the command line function diff. Basically it takes two files as arguments and tells you how they differ from one another. While very good for ascii and text files diff doesn't really do the job when it comes to binary files (like the results files I generate as part of my PhD), I had been using hexdump to print the contents of the file to screen in a readable form for comparison but I recently came across a much neater program for doing this, <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/utils/vbindiff">vbindiff</a> - visual binary diff. It's a curses bases program that lets you see the differences quickly, I've found the program handy and the name hard to remember, hence it is up here for my sieve-like memory.</p>
