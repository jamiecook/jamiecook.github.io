<p>This would have to be one of the sickest weirdest things I've seen for a long time, apparently there a genus of wasp which has developed the ability to produce a venom which turns cockroaches into unthinking zombies which it can then lead back to the wasp nest to become the hatching ground for the wasp's larvae. <a href="http://loom.corante.com/archives/2006/02/02/the_wisdom_of_parasites.php" title="Link outside of this blog">I kid you not</a>!!</p>
