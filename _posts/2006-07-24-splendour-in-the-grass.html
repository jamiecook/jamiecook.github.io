Although a fairly reasonable case could be made to officially change the name to "splendour in the mud" - there was an incredible amount of water on the ground in some places. Thankfully though by sunday the organizers had done some great work to pump out water and put down extra gravel and wood chip so it wasn't too much of a problem. Once your shoes and pants had a certain level of mud on them it wasn't really worth worrying about anyway, still will def be packing the welly's for next year.<br />

Highlights for me were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Death Cab for Cutie - Their new albumn "Plans" is freaking fantastic and it was such a trip to see them live. I mistakenly told someone that they were from Washington D.C. - I would like to correct myself publicly they are from Seatle, <strong>Washington</strong></li>
<li>Youth Group - Saw these guys when the supported Coldplay but we were in the nose bleeds and oculdn't really get the same experience you get from an up close viewing. They lived up to their promise, I hadn't been too impressed with first listen to their new singles but with repetition and a couple of live listenings it has started to grow on me.</li>
<li>Snow Patrol - What can I say about Snow Patrol, they were my favourite act for Sunday. They also have a new albumn out (Eyes open) and were playing a good mix from that and their debut "Final Straw". Both have a lot going for them and I was enraptured throughout their entire set.</li>
<li>The Presets - Hadn't been planning on seeing too much of these guys, but festival are all about checking out bands you wouldn't otherwise see, plus You Am I - who were on in a competing time slot - weren't fantastic. And boy am I glad I did go over to check them out, danced my ass off for the entire set and even skipped Jose Gonzalez to stay the entirety. Gill and I had been planning to see both Presets and Jose but she ended up doing the opposite of me and loving Jose so much that she skipped the Presets - guess thats just festival timing woes.</li>
<li>Scissor Sisters - We showed up about 45 minutes early for these guys and that ended up being a really good call - it was absolutely packed in there. They put on a top show though, the lead singer was wearing a single piece red vinyl jump suit and was getting right into the rock idol mentality with a lot of posing and animating the crowd. They played a lot of stuff off the new albumn which the crowd was a bit skeptical about but the oldies really got people moving, was very impressed with the guitar work they had going on too.</li>
</ul>
