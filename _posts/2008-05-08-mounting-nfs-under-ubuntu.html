<p>Just realised that NFS support is (somehow) not included out of the box with 7.10 so when I added an NFS mount to my fstab like so</p>
<pre><code>
192.168.xx.xx:/bigraid/sunshine  /sunshine nfs user
</code></pre>
<p>and then attempted to mount with "sudo mount /sunshine", I got an error as follows</p>
<pre><code>
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on 192.168.xx.xx:/bigraid/sunshine,
       missing codepage or helper program, or other error
       (for several filesystems (e.g. nfs, cifs) you might
       need a /sbin/mount. helper program)
       In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try
       dmesg | tail  or so
</code></pre>
<p>The solution was as simple as</p>
<pre><code>
sudo apt-get install nfs-common
</code></pre>
