<p><b>Sleeps left in Australia: 3</p>
<p>    </b>Gill and I got back last night from Rockhampton and her friend<br />
    Rollie's wedding. Twas a pretty interesting weekend, on our way to the<br />
    (outdoor) wedding we were pelted with hail stones - apparently if we'd<br />
    been a bit further out of town they were as big as golf balls.</p>
<p>    Twas a lovely ceremony but we forgot to take a camera so no photos.<br />
    People were getting pretty drunk at the reception so it's prolly a good<br />
    thing that there were no photos :)</p>
<p>    We got back to Bris at 6:30 and got a lift and leftovers from Sunday lunch -&gt; Happy Campers!!!!<br />
