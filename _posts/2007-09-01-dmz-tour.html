<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jamiecook/1283634740/" title="Photo Sharing"><img class="alignright" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/1283634740_14bc7105c5_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="DMZ, Korea" /></a> Well it is a rainy miserable day for my last full day in Seoul, so I am sitting in my hotel room and being bored :( So I thought I'd make the time useful and post some stuff up here about my trip so far. On my first day here I bought a new camera and I've been spending the remainder of the trip filling up the 2Gb memory card that I got with it.</p>
<p>On Friday I went and did the DMZ tour which is a fun-ish way to spend half a day, it was very informative though and I learnt a great deal about Korea which I didn't previously know. They were very restrictive on the photo taking however so I didn't get too many photos. To hear the south Koreans tell it the northerns are a sneaky bunch (this is evidenced by the tunnels they were digging while engaging in peace talks) and they think that anyone could be a spy getting information about their setup in the DMZ. They also run all the buses that go in there, so your tour guide takes you to a central spot where about 5-7 groups get on a big bus together for a strictly timed run through the area.</p>
<p>The trip comprised three parts, the first of which was the aforementioned tunnel. You start out with a crappy movie telling you how unification is imminent and has some interesting visuals about a magic butterfly that turns barbed wire into picnic benches. After that you get a quick tour of the attached museum and then it is down, down, down for the main event. It's a fairly steep decline and you drop quickly into the cooler subterranean air (which is a relief from the humidity outside). The descent tunnel is 3m wide and tall but when you get down to the north korean dug tunnel it drops to about 1.6-2m tall and you are required to wear a helmet (and lucky too, I banged my head about 30 times on the 200m walk along to the Military Demarkation Line (MDL) which is guarded by about 3 steel and concrete doors. We only get to see the outermost one but apparently the innermost have equipment for measuring nuclear and biological contaminants to guard against the N.Koreans slipping something nasty down there.</p>

Then it was back to the surface quick quick for a last minute photo with the unification statue (left) and then back on the bus for the next stop. This was the observatory where you can get a decent view of the entire DMZ and even into North Korea, unfortunately it was only 15 minutes so didn't get as much out as I'd have liked. The last spot was the Dorasan train station and the guide pretty much just kept telling us how awesome it would be when the station had regular freight services to the north as it would be cheaper than by truck, why I needed this tit-bit I do not know but as I have it now and cannot unlearn it so the question is moot.</p>
<p>After this we returned to the city and had a stop of some little factory turning out Amethyst for the tourists, this explained how the tour was able to hire someone to look after just four tourists. Basically we were taken there with the intention that we should buy something from this shop, I didn't particularly want anything but eventually came around to their way of thinking (what a sucker!). Then they dropped us off in Itaewon and that was that, not sure why they chose Itaewon as the drop off point (they picked me up from the hotel), perhaps their base was close by. Itaewon is right beside the U.S. Army base and is the most heavily westernised part of Seoul, the majority of the signs are in english and the locals can all say "you want custom suit?" pretty well.</p>
