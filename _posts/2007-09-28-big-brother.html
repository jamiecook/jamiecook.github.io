<p>I just came across an interesting article on <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070927-big-brother-may-be-watching-you-in-chicago.html">Ars Technica</a> regarding a new intelligent camera surveillance system planned for Chicago. Apparently this is part of the windy city's upcoming bid for the 2016 Olympic games, by having a state of the art surveillance and security system in place the hope is that the city will become a more desirable destination.</p>
<blockquote><p>Chicago drivers have had to become accustomed to cameras at certain intersections that snap pictures of red-light-running drivers and a wider surveillance network, while some residents have been arrested for drinking in public after being caught by one of the city's surveillance cameras. Now they'll have to contend with "Operation Virtual Shield," developed by IBM and deployed in conjunction with Chicago's Office of Emergency Management and Communications.</p>
<p>Virtual Shield will capture, monitor, and "fully index" video from the Windy City's surveillance cameras. The software used to run the system will be able to recognize specific license plates, vehicle descriptions, and even patterns of behavior. If someone drops a briefcase on the El platform and it stays unattended for more than a minute, the system could alert the OEMC, which could then dispatch police officers to the scene.</p></blockquote>
