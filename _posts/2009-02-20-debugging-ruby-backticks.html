<p>Stolen from <a href="http://blog.dalethatcher.com/2008/05/ruby-debugging-backticks.html">Dale's blog</a>... reposted here for my own reference. Also this link is good for a reference on<a href="http://rails.elctech.com/blog/i-m-in-ur-commandline-executin-ma-commands"> executing shell commands from ruby</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
I needed to knock up a Ruby script recently that orchestrated some external processes using backticks. However something was going wrong and I need to temporarily peek into the inputs and outputs of the external programs. Ruby bend-ability to the rescue:

<pre>
module Kernel
  alias_method :real_backticks, :'`'

  def `(cmd)
    puts "`#{cmd}` =&gt; #{output = real_backticks(cmd)}"
    output
  end
end
</pre>
