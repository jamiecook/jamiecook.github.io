<p>One of my (new) favourite <a href="http://blag.xkcd.com/">web comics</a> [warning: seriously geeky!!] are taking the the piss out of an attempted viral marketing campaign being run by ask.com. This is basically just to link to them using the text "<a href="http://www.xkcd.com/">THE ALGORITHM IS BANNED IN CHINA</a>".</p>
