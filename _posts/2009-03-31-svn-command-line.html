<p>Have been wondering for a while now how to force the svn command line to resolve conflicts, didn't really see anything on google until I came across this: http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.ref.svn.html</p>
<p>Turns out there is a standard switch which I hadn't found! The accept switch "<em>specifies an action for automatic conflict resolution. Possible actions are postpone, base, mine-full, theirs-full, edit, and launch</em>". So to just use the local version (safest):</p>
<pre>
svn up --accept mine-full directory
</pre>
