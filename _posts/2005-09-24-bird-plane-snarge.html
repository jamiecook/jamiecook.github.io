<p>I didn't really get the heading either but found <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,68937,00.html?tw=rss.TOP" title="Link outside of this blog">this incredibly amusing</a> nonetheless. From the article 'snarge' is the name given to the paste which is left over when birds collide with aircraft. My favourite quote: </p>
<p><i>"The other day we had a bird strike. We sent the sample to the DNA lab<br />
    and it came back as rabbit. How do you explain to the FAA that we had a<br />
    rabbit strike at 1,800 feet?"</p>
<p></i></p>
