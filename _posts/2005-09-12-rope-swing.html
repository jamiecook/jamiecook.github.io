<p>Poor form on keeping a regular post I know but ..... well I have no<br />
    excuse really so I'm just going to tell you all about the latest<br />
    adventures I've been having. </p>
<p>    Yesterday my buddy Chris and I trekked along the muddy banks of the<br />
    delaware river looking for a rope swing that a friend had recommended<br />
    and given (shitty as it turns out) directions to. So we almost turn<br />
    back after having walked about two miles but decided to press on and<br />
    were rewarded with the most beautiful little slice of river life. This<br />
    rope swing had to be secured 30 meters up into a huge tree and we were<br />
    swinging from about 10 off the water... meaning that when we let go we<br />
    were pretty close to 10 meters above water level. Appartently my face<br />
    was pretty funny as I was falling and I suddenly realised that "hey<br />
    shouldn't I have hit water by now???"</p>
<p>    I also managed to hurt myself pretty bad.. I have an incredible rope<br />
    burn on my bicep which I shall endeavour to post photos of (yes it is<br />
    that bad that it warrants online photos). I also think I sprained my<br />
    ring finger (how I did that or why I bothered to write this escape me<br />
    now). Anyways, adventures, good fun... I think we'll go do it again<br />
    today.</p>
<p>    Peace out&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  </p>
