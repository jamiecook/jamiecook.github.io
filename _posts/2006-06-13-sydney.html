<p>Its been a great couple of days, I've spend the last four nights in Sydney for the biometrics consortium annual conference. I flew down on Thursday morning and despite a small snafu with forgetting the poster that I was due to present that morning everything worked out fairly well. Spent the next two days being pretty bored at what was a very vendor/government dominated event but made up for it with a great weekend of shopping and cafes in the city and in funky Newtown. I brought my camera down but haven't taken very many photos so will try and make it up in the last couple of days down here. I fly back this Thursday so I have a couple of days. </p>
<p>Gill is doing some work down in Sydney so she has been here since last friday, and will be staying for two weeks. We've been kicking around together doing a lot of shopping and siteseeing (and a lot of eating). She has a half day today so we are going to spend some of it looking around Redfern (don't ask how I ended up in Redfern) and surrounding suburbs before heading back to Kings Cross to complete our tour of the unsavoury regions of Sydney :)</p>
