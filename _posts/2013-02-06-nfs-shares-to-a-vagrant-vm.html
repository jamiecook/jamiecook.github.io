<p>While I'm on the subject of getting this Vagrant VM working I'll go into what I had to do to get an NFS share working and mounted on this new VM. </p>
<p>According to this post (http://communities.vmware.com/thread/128695) getting a NFS mount to work through a firewalled or natted connection. The solution (if you are able) is to edit the /etc/exports entry for the mount point you want to use and add the 'insecure' option. </p>
<p>Don't forget to restart the service afterwards with<br />
<code>sudo service nfs-kernel-server restart</code></p>
<p>Refer here for more comprehensive nfs setup details: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NFSv4Howto</p>
