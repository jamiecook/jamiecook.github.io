<p>This has got to be one of the coolest 3D applications I have ever seen, I'm not sure how to describe it exactly but the video below makes it pretty clear what this program is capable of. Insane!

<blockquote><i>"Takeo Igarashi from the University of Tokyo has a very impressive java applet/program, called Teddy, which he describes as <a href="http://www-ui.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/%7Etakeo/teddy/teddy/teddy.html">'A Sketching Interface for 3D Freeform Design'</a>, and basically allows you to sketch in simple 2D and have it automatically converted to full 3D. The tool is certainly very impressive and there is a <a href="http://lazyrussian.com/2006/09/15/freaky-friday-episode-3-teddy/">demonstration video</a> available. The end product looks like a hand-drawn object instead of the usual clinical, perfect 3D objects that are designed using standard rendering tools."</i></p></blockquote>
