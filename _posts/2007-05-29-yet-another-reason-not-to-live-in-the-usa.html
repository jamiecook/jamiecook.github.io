<p>The <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070528-illinois-raids-welfare-to-pay-for-failed-video-game-violence-legislation.html">following</a> is stolen, I mean borrowed from the wonderful <a href="http://arstechnica.com/">Ars Technica</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p>When the State of Illinois was tardy in paying its legal bills after attempting to defend a law that regulated the sale of violent and sexually explicit video games, the Entertainment Software Association wondered about the reasons for the delay. Now they know: the state was scouring department budgets, looking for the $1 million it cost to defend the unconstitutional legislation in court. Yes, you read that rightâ€”the State of Illinois spent one <em>meeeellion</em> dollars of taxpayer money on the litigation even as the state budget was starved for cash in other, more pressing areas. And worse yet, they spent it on a bill which, when introduced, was plainly unconstitutional.</p></blockquote>
