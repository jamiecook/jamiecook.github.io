<p>I've just managed to get my automatic pinging of sites such as technorati working withm my new permanent link structure and I noticed that when my posts were showing up in technorati they would be called something like "Permanent Link to Gentoo emerge". Obviously not a huge problem as they are actually showing up (step in the right direction<sup>TM</sup>) but it doesn't look very professional. </p>
<p>I think I've fixed this up by editting my current theme to remove all instances of "Permanent Link to" in the titles. This post is mainly to check if it has worked or not. </p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> That seems to have done the trick.</p>
