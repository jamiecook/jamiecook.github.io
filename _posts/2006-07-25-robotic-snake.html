<p><a href="http://www.innovations-report.com/html/reports/energy_engineering/report-67839.html"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/anna_konda_2.jpg" class="alignright" /></a>More from the robotics arena, researchers from Norway have developed a robotic snake which is 3 m long and weighs 70 kg. The robot is propelled by 20 hydraulic motors which are powered directly from pressurized water within a firehose - apparently there is enough energy available to lift a car or break through a wall.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It is much like the grab on an excavator where different joints and movements are co-ordinated by the operator. In this instance, the operator is the computer,” says Pål Liljebäck of SINTEF. “There are angle sensors in each joint, and we can decide with conplete accuracy the angle that we want in the joints. A camera in the snake’s head makes operating the snake like driving a remote-controlled car. The operator can tell the snake to move from A to B, and the snake works out on its own how to accomplish this. It knows how to cross a pile of materials, climb down on the back side and twist itself round objects in order to get footing.”</p></blockquote>
