<p>After recompiling my version of php5 to support the new wordpress widgets I started getting these messages from mysql (/var/log/mysql/mysqld.err)</p>
<p><code><br />
060810 12:01:52 [Warning] â€˜./mysql/hostâ€™ had no or invalid character set, and default character set is multi-byte, so character column sizes may have changed<br />
060810 12:01:52 [Warning] â€˜./mysql/userâ€™ had no or invalid character set, and default character set is multi-byte, so character column sizes may have changed<br />
060810 12:01:52 [Warning] â€˜./mysql/dbâ€™ had no or invalid character set, and default character set is multi-byte, so character column sizes may have changed<br />
060810 12:01:52 [ERROR] Fatal error: mysql.user table is damaged or in unsupported 3.20 format.<br />
</code></p>
<p>Thankfully I found the following <a href="http://grebowiec.net/2006/08/10/131/">series of instructions</a>,</p>
<p><code>mysqld_safe -â€“skip-grant-tables -â€“user=root &amp;<br />
mysql_fix_privilege_tables<br />
pkill mysqld<br />
/etc/init.d/mysqld restart</code></p>
<p>This simply starts mysql as user root ignoring the now defunct table structure in the users file.  This fixed my immediate problem, but I then found that my <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/resetting-permissions.html">passwords had been corrupted aswell</a>... sigh!</p>
<p>   1. Stop mysqld and restart it with the --skip-grant-tables --user=root options (Windows users omit the --user=root portion).<br />
   2. Connect to the mysqld server with this command:<br />
      shell&gt; mysql -u root<br />
   3. Issue the following statements in the mysql client:<br />
      mysql&gt; UPDATE mysql.user SET Password=PASSWORD('newpwd')<br />
            -&gt;                   WHERE User='root';<br />
      mysql&gt; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;<br />
      Replace â€œnewpwdâ€ with the actual root password that you want to use.<br />
   4. You should be able to connect using the new password.</p>
<p>Then I had to repeat step 3 of the above procedure for all the other users in the mysql.user table as their passwords had been corrupted aswell.</p>
