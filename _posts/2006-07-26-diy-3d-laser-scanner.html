<p><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/ESQ41476M3EP285ZU2/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/F8ULIVBQAHEP27QH5T.medium.jpg" class="alignright" height="360" width="277" /></a>I've got to try this out sometime, and seeing as it fits nicely into my work with 3D face recognition I don't even have to do it on my own time :)</p>
<blockquote><p>Create your own super hi-tech 3-D laser scanner. Using just a laser pointer, wine glass, rotating platform, and a digital video camera, you can make accurate 3-D models of a object or person.</p>
<ol>
<li>Convert the video to an avi.</li>
<li>Use an edge detection algorithm to find the location of the laser line.</li>
<li>Reconstruct your 3-D model</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Update: I've had trouble downloading the m-file so when I got it down I put it up <a href="http://jamie.homelinux.org/Assets/3D_scanner_script.m">here</a> for anyone to grab.</p>
