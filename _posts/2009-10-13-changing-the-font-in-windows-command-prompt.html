<p>Should be easy but it's not... like some pretty basic things in windows this one actually requires a registry edit in order to use the fonts that are already installed on your system for your command prompt.</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Console\TrueTypeFont</p>
<p>There you will see a string value (0 =&gt; "Lucida Console") or something similar, to add your own fonts which will show up you have to add a new string value with the name of your required font (00 =&gt; "Consolas"). Subsequent fonts can be added at (000 =&gt; "someotherfont") etc. I then had to do some dicking around to get the properties to stick on my command prompt shortcut but eventually I had a nice looking font for my command line hacking. Best of luck to you!</p>
