<p>Well I've managed to do it again. Apparently I'm incapable of keeping a<br />
passport for more than 6 months without immersing it in water or losing<br />
it completely! </p>
<p>So now I have to fly down to sydney to present my ugly mug at the<br />
consulate before they will start the paper work to get my replacement<br />
passport started. So I'm flying down next thursday at an obscene hour<br />
of the morning and I'm still $180 out of pocket not counting the $160<br />
it costs for the replacement passport. I swear I'm going to have the<br />
bloody thing surgically attached to my body so I can never lose it<br />
again. There is definetly something to the entire biometrics thing! If<br />
I never had to worry about super-important identification papers like<br />
this again I'd take all the big brother shit that goes along with it.</p>
<p>On the plus side of things tho I do (apparently) have a job waiting for<br />
me in NJ, USA!!! I say apparently because the paper work is waiting on<br />
higher level management approval but the paper work has been started<br />
and I'm hoping to be able to get out of the country by late next month.<br />
I've got a lot of organising to do before I leave. </p>
<p>J</p>
