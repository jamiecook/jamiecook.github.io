<p>I just found this thing, which is piss funny... the stick figure guy has been around for a while so if you like this there is other stuff of his out there (also piss funny). They seem to be hosted on <a href="http://www.atomfilms.com/film/animator_vs_animation">atomfilms</a> but they required a version of flash that I didn't have so I am putting the youtube version here. enjoy!</p>
