<p>MythTV uses xine to play media files it has no clue about, generally this is xine (although I think I've seen it use mplayer occasionally). Out of the box xine doesn't play real media files so some fiddling was in order to get that working.</p>
<p>First I downloaded the mplayer codecs from <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/homepage/design7/dload.html">mplayerHQ</a>. I grabbed the linux x86 binaries and unzipped them to /usr/lib/win32</p>
<pre><code>
...
wget ftp://ftp1.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/codecs/essential-20061022.tar.bz2
tar xvjf essential-20061022.tar.bz2
mkdir /usr/lib/win32
mv essential-20061022/* /usr/lib/win32
</code></pre>
<p>I then went into my xine config file for the mythtv user (/home/mythtv/.xine/config) and uncommented the following line, making sure that it pointed to the same directory that I created in the previous step.</p>
<pre><code>
...
# path to RealPlayer codecs
# string, default: /usr/lib/codecs
decoder.external.real_codecs_path:/usr/lib/win32
</code></pre>
