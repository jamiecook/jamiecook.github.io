<p>Okay I'm coming out and saying that I've been using this expression wrong for quite some time now as "the proof is in the pudding" my rationale being that the proof of a good dinner (party) was in the dessert that was served; i.e. if you have a lovely steak dinner followed by a $3 cheesecake from 7-11 its not going quite so well.</p>
<p>However, that doesn't make a whole lot of historical sense so I did some research and I feel that this guy sums it up the best.</p>
<blockquote><p>
[Q] From Terry Cleary: “I have heard BBC reporters say ‘the proof is in the pudding’. Surely the phrase should be ‘the proof of the pudding is in the eating’.”</p>
<p>[A] Indeed it should.</p>
<p>The principal trouble with the proof is in the pudding is that it makes no sense. What has happened is that writers half-remember the proverb as the proof of the pudding, which is also unintelligible unless you know the full form from which the tag was taken, and have modified it in various ways in unsuccessful attempts to turn it into something sensible.</p>
<p>They wouldn’t make this mistake if they knew two important facts. The full proverb is indeed the proof of the pudding is in the eating and proof has the sense of “test” (as it also has, or used to have, in phrases such as proving-ground and printer’s proof). The proverb literally says that you won’t know whether food has been cooked properly until you try it. Or, putting it figuratively, don’t assume that something is in order or believe what you are told, but judge the matter by testing it; it’s much the same philosophy as in seeing is believing and actions speak louder than words.</p>
<p>The proverb is ancient — it has been traced back to 1300 and was popularised by Cervantes in his Don Quixote of 1605. It’s sad that it has lasted so long, only to be corrupted in modern times.</p></blockquote>
