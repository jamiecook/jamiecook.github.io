<p>Saw a cool use of the copious number of CCTV cameras being pointed at UK citizens and felt I had to share.</p>

<blockquote><p>Unable to afford a proper camera crew and equipment, The Get Out Clause, an unsigned band from the city, decided to make use of the cameras seen all over British streets. With an estimated 13 million CCTV cameras in Britain, suitable locations were not hard to come by. They set up their equipment, drum kit and all, in eighty locations around Manchester \u2013 including on a bus \u2013 and proceeded to play to the cameras.</p></blockquote>
