<p>If you are like me and are using firefox you'll probably have noticed that your desktop has become a bit more cluttered now that all your downloads are being sent there. I've recently been cleaning mine up and finding some pretty wallpapers from deviant art to brighten things up a bit. I've managed to remove just about everything from there except the bloody recycle bin - thankfully there is help at hand.</p>
<p>Undeletable icons on the desktop are controlled by entries in the registry at :<br />
<code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Desktop\NameSpace</code><br />
in my case I'm trying to remove the "Recycle Bin" and the "My Bluetooth Places" which can be achieved by deleting the following keys<br />
<code><br />
{645FF040-5081-101B-9F08-00AA002F954E} - Recycle Bin<br />
{6af09ec9-b429-11d4-a1fb-0090960218cb} - Bluetooth Icon<br />
</code></p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.petri.co.il/delete_recycle_bin_icon_from_the_desktop_in_xp_2003.htm">Daniel</a> for the info.</p>
