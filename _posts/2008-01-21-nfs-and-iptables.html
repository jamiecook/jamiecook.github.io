<p>Trying to share a folder on my fedora box with my new ubuntu box, couldn't figure out why it wasn't able to connect, until I remember good ole iptables (sigh). And the issue is complicated by the fact that nfs seems to start its various services on random ports (sigh)... still I found a good post <a href="http://fconfig.wordpress.com/2006/08/17/setting-up-a-fedora-nfs-server/">here </a>which got me through it.</p>
<pre>
cat &gt;&gt; /etc/sysconfig/nfs
LOCKD_TCPPORT=48620
LOCKD_UDPPORT=48620
MOUNTD_PORT=48621
STATD_PORT=48622
RQUOTAD=no
RQUOTAD_PORT=48623
^D
</pre>
<p>then put together a little script to allow the requisite ports to be opened via iptables</p>
<pre>
cat &gt; ~/iptable-allow.sh
#!/bin/bash
for i in 111 2049 48620 48621 48622 48623
do
  iptables -I INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport $i -j ACCEPT
  iptables -I INPUT -m state --state NEW -m udp -p udp --dport $i -j ACCEPT
done
^D
</pre>
<p>then a quick</p>
<pre>
chmod +x ~/iptable-allow.sh
~/iptable-allow.sh
</pre>
<p>and I was in business</p>
