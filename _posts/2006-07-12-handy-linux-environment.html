<p>A very handy little binding to have when you are working in the bash shell... instead of pressing up many times to get to a previous command you can type the first few characters and then press Ctrl-P to skip all previous commands which don't match what you've typed and go directly too it. This is incredibly handy when you have long commands and a have been prolific on the command line.</p>
<p>You can enable this by adding the following lines to your ~/.bashrc file</p>
<pre>
# rebind Ctrl+n and Crtl+p to search history based on command line rather than just browse through history
bind "\C-p":history-search-backward
bind "\C-n":history-search-forward
</pre>
<p>Also you can bind Ctrl-K to kill the entire line instead of just the portion from the cursor to the end of line with</p>
<pre>
# rebind Ctrl+k to delete whole line
bind "\C-k":kill-whole-line
</pre>
