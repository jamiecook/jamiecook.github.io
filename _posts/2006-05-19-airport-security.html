<p>I just saw a couple of articles on a company called <a href="http://www.vidient.com/" title="Link outside of this blog">Vidient</a>, who are in the process of rolling out their SmartCatch technology to the <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/may2006/gb20060516_487630.htm" title="Link outside of this blog">international airport</a> in Helsinki. They claim to offer the ability to "<i>automatically monitors CCTV footage and can recognise<br />
    potential security threats. It also flags up operational issues such as<br />
    building queues and bottlenecks of human traffic through customs and<br />
    security.</i>" </p>
<p>They have also been behind government funded program to incorporate the same smart surveillance technology in <a href="http://software.silicon.com/security/0,39024655,39158050,00.htm" title="Link outside of this blog">San Francisco International</a>. Asked about whether this system had ever actually stopped any known terrorists airport security manager Paul Foster replied "<i>Did I stop a bad guy or did I just stop an employee from doing something they shouldn't be doing? I can't be certain. People in security look at things differently.</i>" Well dodged!</p>
