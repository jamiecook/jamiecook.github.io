<p><a href="http://wired.com/wired/archive/14.08/start.html?pg=3">This guy</a> is finally standing up to the bully-boy tactics employed by the MPAA and RIAA. I say all power to him, lets hope that by upgrading from suing clueless parents to a wealthy technology enthusiast they have bitten off more than they can chew. </p>
<blockquote><p>Last November, Shawn Hogan received an unsettling call: A lawyer representing Universal Pictures and the Motion Picture Association of America informed the 30-year-old software developer that they were suing him for downloading <cite>Meet the Fockers</cite> over BitTorrent. Hogan was baffled. Not only does he deny the accusation, he says he already owned the film on DVD. The attorney said they would settle for $2,500. Hogan declined.</p>
<p>Hogan, who coded his way to millions as the CEO of Digital Point Solutions, is determined to change this. Though he expects to incur more than $100,000 in legal fees, he thinks it’s a small price to pay to challenge the MPAA’s tactics. “They’re completely abusing the system,” Hogan says. “I would spend well into the millions on this.”</p></blockquote>
