<p>Very interesting hardware related problem, the machine (T43) was just randomly freezing up on me. The crazy thing was that I could get it to keep going by applying pressure around the middle of the keyboard (which is where the track pointer is). Must be some kind of loose connector inside, anyways I've called IBM technical support up and was very impressed with how quickly they responded. As soon as the guy on the phone established that it wasn't a software problem (it happened when running their non-windows diagnostic tools) he sent a courier right over to pick it up and 'have it back within 4-5 business days'. I'm not sure whether that will actually happen but it's still been a pretty painless experience so far, even the fact that I bought the machine overseas was a very minor hiccup - he told me that I'd bought it overseas and then fixed it all up at his end.</p>
<p>Will keep updating with developments</p>
