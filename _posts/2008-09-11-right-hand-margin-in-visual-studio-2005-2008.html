<p>I don't like having lines longer than 100 characters long in my source code. Many editors will allow you to specify a right hand margin so that you can see when a line is longer and hence wrap it sensibly to the next line. To do this in Visual Studio, however, requires a bit more work. As described in <a href="http://resharper.blogspot.com/2007/09/visualize-right-margin-in-visual-studio.html">this</a> blog post, you have to edit the registry to make Visual Studio display nice dotted vertical lines at specific column:</p>
<p>    * Open "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\9.0\Text Editor" key<br />
    * Create new string value "Guides"<br />
    * Set its value to something like "RGB(192,192,192) 119" (columns in registry are zero-based)<br />
    * Restart Visual Studio</p>
<p>This works in VS2005 as well, just change 9.0 to 8.0 in the reg location.</p>
