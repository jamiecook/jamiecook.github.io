<p>You've all probably heard at some point or another mention of the<br />
    shining beacon in the great American fight against piracy that is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMCA" title="Link outside of this blog">DMCA </a>(Digital<br />
    Millenium Copyright Act). If you read the same news sources I do then<br />
    you will probably not have heard it mentioned in a greatly flattering<br />
    context, among the hubub surrouding this contentious piece of<br />
    legislation some hard facts are starting to emerge. Researchers at<br />
    University of Southern California and UC Berkley have released their<br />
    research into the (chilling) effects of the 'ceast and desist' type<br />
    provisions contained within the bill. <a href="http://arstechnica.com/" title="Link outside of this blog">Ars Technica</a>, as always, has a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20051123-5620.html" title="Link outside of this blog">good write up</a> on the issue.</p>
<p><i><br />
    The study shows some interesting results about who is issuing these summary notices and what their<br />
    primary motivations are.  Over 84% of the notices are sent to Google, not to the ISP hosting the material<br />
    in question.  While the removal of a Google link makes a site much more difficult to find, it does not<br />
    remove the material from the Internet itself.  Most of the corporations sending the notices are<br />
    small Internet businesses.  <b>55% of the notices sent to Google are requests to remove links to the<br />
    complainant's direct business competitors</b>.  A surprisingly low 6% of notices were sent by the music<br />
    and movie industry.</i>

<p>
    In a word - scary. </p>
