<p>Well I am now officially returned from holidays, I had my first day<br />
    back at work on Friday and am now enjoying a nice buffer weekend. </p>
<p>    California was so sweet, we were staying with my dad in Chico and had a<br />
    sweet setup in his pool house. The heat was pretty full on, got up to<br />
    106 (41) at one point and was consistently around the 105 mark,<br />
    translation for celcius - HOT!! But it was a nice dry heat which made<br />
    it very bearable, as did the swimming pool and fridge stocked with beer<br />
    (mmm mexican beer - much better than the swill americans call beer)</p>
<p>    Got to hang out with my sister Alisa heaps and her young ward<br />
    Johnathon. He is a lovely young man just turned 13 and has grown like a<br />
    weed since the last time I saw him. Lovely manners but I think he lost<br />
    a pair of boardshorts that I lent him - bugger. </p>
<p>    Also got to hang out with my other sister Annette, who had just had her<br />
    birthday. We all went up to the penthouse of Waynes new hotel and had a<br />
    big do up there with a whole bunch of their friends, I started too<br />
    early and had to crash out about 11 (this probably won't suprise too<br />
    many people but it is actually the exception rather than the norm now).</p>
<p>    San Francisco was the last port of call before returning and it was a<br />
    great stop over. The hotel we stayed in was f'ing lush - we got<br />
    upgraded to a suite and I seriously did not want to leave at the end of<br />
    it. We got dolled up and went out on Union Street had some great sushi,<br />
    enjoyed lots of fine beer. Then woke up early (and bleary eyed) the<br />
    next morning for some serious shopping, got some new jeans to replace<br />
    the pair I bought last time I was in SF (stolen from my washing line<br />
    thank you very much). Then went to Haight street shopped drank and ate<br />
    until it was time to go to the airport, was a very hip and groovy<br />
    place. It was apparently the official headquarters of flower power back<br />
    in the sixties and still had a good vibe to this day, they had this<br />
    vaporiser room with the door open and the smell of pot was<br />
    overpowering. No one cared! Sweet!</p>
<p>    Anyway, shaping up to be a good weekend too, went to yoga for the first<br />
    time since being here and met a new friend. But I'll save all that for<br />
    my next post.</p>
