<p>Two quotes today (or perhaps motto is more appropriate) which were commonly found on public clocks in previous years:</p>
<ul>
<li>ultima forsan ("perhaps the last" [hour])</li>
<li>vulnerant omnes, ultima necat ("they all wound, and the last kills").</li>
</ul>
<p>and one which I actually found as a the title from a Streets song</p>
<ul>
<li>Memento Mori ("Remember your death") - It is a statement and an artform apparently</li>
</ul>
<p>A bit morbid but there you go.</p>
