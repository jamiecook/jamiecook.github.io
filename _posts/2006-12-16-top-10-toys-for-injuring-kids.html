<p><a href="http://www.radarmagazine.com/features/2006/12/toys.php"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/scary-jarts.jpg" alt="Jarts" /></a>And surprisingly the post title is actually 100% spot on the actual subject matter of this article. Very funny story over at <a href="http://www.radarmagazine.com">radar magazine</a> about toys which most likely would never see the light of day in the current culture of litigation and deferred responsibility, but which still totally rocked!!!!</p>
<p>First up are the rockin' lawn darts (why crush your grass when you can get the kids to aerate it for you?)</p>
<blockquote><p>Lawn darts were massive weighted spears. You threw them. They stuck where they landed. If they happened to land in your skull, well, then you should have moved. During their brief (and generally awesome) reign in 1980s suburbia, Jarts racked up 6,700 injuries and four deaths.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.radarmagazine.com/features/2006/12/fisherprice_power_wheels_motorcycle.php"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/power-wheels-motorcycle.jpg" alt="Motorcycle of Death" /></a>Then (and I shit you not) the kids nuclear physics set, complete with radioactive material!!!!</p>
<blockquote><p>
For a mere $49.50, the kit came complete with three "very low-level" radioactive sources, a Geiger-Mueller radiation counter, a Wilson Cloud Chamber (to see paths of alpha particles), a Spinthariscope (to see "live" radioactive disintegration), four samples of Uranium-bearing ores, and an Electroscope to measure radioactivity.<br />
It's unclear what effects the Uranium-bearing ores might have had on those few lucky children who received the set, but exposure to the same isotope—U-238—has been linked to Gulf War syndrome, cancer, leukemia, and lymphoma, among other serious ailments.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And who could imagine that combining Barbie's sparkle with the power of a bottle rocket would end up in tears?</p>
<blockquote><p>But six years later, the Sky Dancer was grounded. When spun aloft, the wings—which felt so soft and cushy in the aisles of Toys "R" Us—turned into steely-hard child manglers. In 2000, the CPSC announced that over 150 children fell prey to Sky Dancer's helicopter-blade arms and erratic "Oh-Jesus-it's-chasing-me!" flying patterns. Injuries included scratched corneas and temporary blindness, mild concussions, broken ribs and teeth, and facial lacerations that required stitches. Nearly nine million Sky Dancers were eventually recalled, leaving aspiring ballerinas to earn their battle scars the old fashioned way, with an eating disorder.</p></blockquote>
<p>And finally the motor cycle of death with throttle that wouldn't turn off.</p>
<blockquote><p>Eager youngsters who gunned the throttle found that it often stayed gunned, stuck in a petrifying state of perma-acceleration. Presumably, the child on the motorcycle was then taken on a hellish, intestine-twisting scream ride. At one point, he or she would face choices unthinkable except in an Evel Knievel meets Knightrider crossover episode: Do I jump? Or do I ride it out and see if I can clear the gully? Is it sentient? Can it be reasoned with?</p></blockquote>
