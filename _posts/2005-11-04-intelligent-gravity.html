<p><i>KANSAS CITY, KSâ€”As the debate over the teaching of evolution in public<br />
    schools continues, a new controversy over the science curriculum arose<br />
    Monday in this embattled Midwestern state. Scientists from the<br />
    Evangelical Center For Faith-Based Reasoning are now asserting that the<br />
    long-held "theory of gravity" is flawed, and they have responded to it<br />
    with a new theory of Intelligent Falling.</p>
<p></i>And yes I do see the irony in asking for gods blessing.<i><br /></i></p>
