<p>Wow that a heck of a post title isn't it... well the up shoot of this post is to point out the non-intuitive (to me anyway) difference in the precedence of the two AND operators in ruby. The operator '&amp;&amp;' has a much higher precedence than 'and', more importantly 'and' has a lower precedence than the assignment operator '='. So what does this mean....</p>
<pre>
a = 'test'
b = nil
both = a &amp;&amp; b       # both == nil
both = a and b      # both == 'test'
both = (a and b)    # both == nil
</pre>
<p>In the second case the statement evaluates as</p>
<pre>
(both = a) and b   # the result of this statement would be false, but it's never used or assigned.
</pre>
<p>So the upshoot is ALWAYS use '&amp;&amp;' to avoid unintentional failure!</p>
