<p>So I wanted to do some numerical computing in ruby (who needs SciPy anyways) so the best advice out there seemed to be to install the GNU scientific libraries (GSL - http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) and then get the comprehensive ruby bindings for it (http://rb-gsl.rubyforge.org/). Sounds easy enough right? Not really... here is how I did it (maybe, I haven't finished yet)</p>
<p>1) Install the FULL MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) - I was able to use the automated installer http://www.mingw.org/wiki/InstallationHOWTOforMinGW<br />
2) Run MSYS.bat (for me this was C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\msys.bat)<br />
3) mount c:/MinGW /mingw<br />
4) mount c:/gsl /gsl<br />
5) cd /gsl/gsl-1.16<br />
6) ./configure<br />
7) make<br />
8) make a cup of tea... and wait</p>
