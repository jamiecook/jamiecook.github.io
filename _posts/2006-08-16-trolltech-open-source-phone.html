<p>I definetly wouldn't mind having one of these for own to have and to hold.&nbsp;<br />

<p><i>The Greenphone appears to be a working GSM/GPRS mobile phone endowed with a bootloader amenable to letting users re-flash the phone with modified Linux-based firmware, via a mini-USB port. The phone will not be available standalone, but rather as part of a development kit. The kit will be offered under separate licensing terms to open source developers, educational institutions, "major" software vendors, and to "phone designers and manufacturers," Trolltech says. <font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="3"></p>
<p>Trolltech says it hopes the Greenphone will help foster a third-party application ecosystem around its <a href="http://linuxdevices.com/news/NS8500486718.html" target="new"><u>Qtopia Phone Edition</u></a> (QPE) Linux mobile phone stack. Such an ecosystem is "critical in satisfying growing customer demands, and shortening development and delivery cycle times," it says.</font></i></p>
