<p>It is a lovely sunny sunday and I am sitting (for the second day in a row) in my office and wanting to go home. I have finished my work for the day and I am currently in the process of booking my flights back to Australia though so it is not really too bad.</p>
<p>Looks like I'll be coming back on sunday the 4th of December, at around 7am in the morning. Bit of a shitter about the early start esp. since Gill is organizing a big concert for the night before but it was either that or come back even later in the week. </p>
<p>Been seeing some really good photos up on <a href="http://www.flicrk.com" title="Link outside of this blog">flickr</a> recently, I've joined a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/jamiecook" title="Link outside of this blog">fire twirling</a> group and seeing all these pictures of flames is making me want to get into it even more. Can't wait to get back to Aus and get some of my own pictures up there. </p>
<p>I've been boring so that is about it for posting now, I'll leave you with a scary shot Gill took pre undead party. An even scarier thought is "If they looked like that before the party, what did they look like the morning after the party ..... ?"</p>
