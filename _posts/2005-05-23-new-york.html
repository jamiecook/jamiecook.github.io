<p>Well I finally managed to get out of New Jersey and made it into New<br />
	York to see my man JP. I ducked out of work and straight onto a train,<br />
	then I met up with Jason and two of his work friends from IBM at a<br />
	Seafood restaurant in White Plains (about 30 min north of manhattan).<br />
	We then caught a late screening of Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith,<br />
	which is a&nbsp; whole lot better than the first two (in my opinion<br />
	anyway).</p>
<p>	Then on Saturday Jason and I went into manhattan for a tourist day. We<br />
	walked around and got a whole lot of good photos which I've posted up<br />
	to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86282888@N00/" title="Link outside of this blog">flickr</a>, below is a small selection and you can check out more on the website itself.</p>
