<p>This is I think the start of something really big. As of today (14-July-2006) users on MSN Messenger and Y! IM will be able to add each other to their contact lists and <a href="http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/software/soa/Yahoo_MSN_encrypt_community_traffic/0,2000061733,39263307,00.htm">pass message between the two networks</a>. I personally only have ever had one friend (hello Leah) who used the Yahoo client but I know that there are a lot of people outside of Australia who do - I personally use MSN and Google IM and cant wait for the time when all these networks will be able to talk to one another. </p>
<p>In Australia the majority of people (at least that I know) are running MSN but when I was living in the states it was quite incredible the number of people who were using AIM as the their one and only chat client and had never thought about logging on to MSN (even though it comes pre-installed on their computers). A friend recently pointed out to me the possibility of using a Jabber based client (like <a href="http://gaim.sourceforge.net/">gaim</a>, or <a href="http://www.google.com/talk/">google talk</a>) to connect to a <a href="http://www.jabber.org">jabber</a> gateway such as http://www.jabber.org.au/ which then does the connection to various networks for you. While this is a step more sophisticated than all-in-one wonder client like trillian, which could connect to multiple networks at once, it still doesn't provide the ability to have a single online identity with which other users can communicate. </p>
<p>In many ways the current situation is very much like the early days of email when individual ISPs had their own walled gardens and communication between them was unthinkable. I think that the breaking down of these walls will also help propel IM into a much more useful communication tool. Imagine not being able to email a potential customer because he was on a different email network to you. I think it can only do good things for IM clients aswell as people realise they don't need the addition bloat that go with the latest versions of the proprietry clients (I'm looking squarely at AIM and MSN here).</p>
