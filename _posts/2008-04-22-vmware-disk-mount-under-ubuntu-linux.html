<p>I'm running ubuntu linux as my main OS with a windows XP VM for all those things I just have to have windows for (like writing plugins for a must have application). The problem I sometimes have with this is that disk accesss can be terrible from inside the VM, like cleaning up 20 odd Gb of data that were cluttering up the disk image - thankfully if you shut down the VM you are able to mount the disk image natively and perform operations on it.</p>
<pre>
sudo mkdir /mnt/winxp_one
sudo vmware-mount.pl /var/vm/WinXP_One/Windows\ XP\ Professional.vmdk 1 /mnt/winxp_one/
</pre>
<p>And then suddenly I can navigate my C drive from that mount point and delete that 20Gb of files in 20 seconds instead of 20 minutes like it would have been under windows.</p>
<pre>
[dev@stoner:/mnt/winxp_one/BDK] ls ../
AUTOEXEC.BAT  CONFIG.SYS              MSDOS.SYS     pagefile.sys   ruby
BDK           Documents and Settings  NTDETECT.COM  PDOXUSRS.NET   System Volume Information
boot.ini      dump.txt                ntldr         Program Files  temp
Config.Msi    IO.SYS                  OT            RECYCLER       WINDOWS
[dev@stoner:/mnt/winxp_one/BDK]
</pre>
<p>However, I did have to manually kill the process after I had finished in order to release the lock on the vmdk file</p>
<pre>
[dev@stoner:/mnt] ps -e | grep vm
