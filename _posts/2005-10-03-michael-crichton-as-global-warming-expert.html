<p>I find this very hard to accept but apparently based on his recently published book "State of Fear" which presents a "<a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=74" title="Link outside of this blog">eco-terrorists are just plain making up this global warming thing</a>" type plot, he has been invited to present his viewpoint to the US senate.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://arstechnica.com/columns/science/science-20051001.ars" title="Link outside of this blog">ArsTechnica</a></p>
<p>"<i>Despite maintaining a fringe position held only by those in the pay or<br />
