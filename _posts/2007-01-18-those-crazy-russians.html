<blockquote>
<p>Winter is the time for a routine maintenance of the Matrix. In order to free up computing resources necessary for garbage collection they decrease the duration of daytime, strip trees of foliage and paint the sky in a unform gray color. All this helps to decrease the amount of computation required to render [the Matrix]. </p>
<p>They used to cover everything with a layer of uniform white snow but with the recent increase in computing power that is no longer necessary. The rumor has it that after the next upgrade cycle there will not be any need for a dedicated winter at all.</p>
