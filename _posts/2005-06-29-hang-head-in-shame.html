<p>For being so slack, I've been pretty dead tired with work lately. Gill<br />
    is coming over to visit me here at the end of next month and I've been<br />
    told I have a lot of work to do before I am allowed to go out and play<br />
    :)</p>
<p>    While she is here (I know she doesn't read this so I can refer to her<br />
    in the third person) we are going to be taking a little trip over to<br />
    california to visit my dad and my sisters. We have one week here on the<br />
    east coast, probably going to be staying in NY for a while and showing<br />
    her around my place here in Jersey. </p>
<p>    Then after a week we are both jumping on (seperate) planes and meeting<br />
    up in San Fran, where we shall hire a car and drive up to Chico. We<br />
    have one week there before we fly our seperate ways. </p>
<p>    Speaking of New York it is my birthday this weekend and I think I'll<br />
    head into NY with my flatmate Matt and hit the town for a bit of money<br />
    draining birthday goodness. </p>
<p>    I've been meaning to get some more photos up but my camera has<br />
    developed a problem with the data cable :( I'm in the process of buying<br />
    a card reader so I'll have some photos up in the near future, til then<br />
    have a great one y'all. </p>
<p>    Jamie</p>
