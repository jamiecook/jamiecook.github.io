<p>Well, I've been meaning to publish one of these things for a while so<br />
when I finally had something worth writing about i had to get on with<br />
it. </p>
<p>I finally heard back from my friend Darren who is working in the<br />
states, he has organised me a position with his company for a 6 month<br />
stint as a junior researcher. This is so freaking awesome I can't<br />
describe! I have a phone interview with his boss tonight and I'm pretty<br />
nervous even tho he says it is pretty much a formality. </p>
<p>More news when I've got it.</p>
<p>J</p>
