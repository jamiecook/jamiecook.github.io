Gill is working at the Kawana shopping center keeping the kids entertained with art workshops while mum/dad go off and do the shopping so she is staying with mum until the end of the week.</p>
<p>We left to head up there on Good Friday and hit some god awful traffic but finally got up there in time for lunch, Becky had taken the new puppy Leah up there on thursday so I was keen to see how she was interacting with mum's two dogs. Turns out the old one that was never very friendly towards other dogs got used to her pretty quickly, and the younger Labrador became best friends (even if they had different views on ball chasing). And mum literally fell in love with her, she picked up so many bad habits from that naughty old woman, but as neither of us kids are planning on making her a grandma yet she has to spoil someone [hi mum :)]. So Leah was having a ball (figuratively, Nduma would never let her have the literal ball) and we turned to chocolate to keep us occupied, I know you aren't meant to have it until the sunday but there was so much that if consumed on a single day there would be casualties.</p>

Now this isn't your grandma's garden, mum has 4 1/2 acres of hilly land and a large part of that is covered by choking snake weed. If you've never seen this shit be grateful as it is a devil to get out of there, some of the plants had main trunks that were thicker than my wrist. Thankfully mum has an industrial strength lawnmower that is up to the job and I spent a lot of time hauling that thing up hill and down. I really should have taken before and after shots because it was amazing how it changed from an unwelcoming dark forest to a beautiful green meadow in such a short time. Of course the stumps of the recently deceased snake weed were still there and still thick so you had to watch your feet.</p>
