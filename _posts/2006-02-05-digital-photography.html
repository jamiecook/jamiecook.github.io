<p>Today I finally got my christmas present from Gill, a digital photography workshop with the guys she works for. And I have to say it was worth waiting for, they put on a really helpful and useful presentation which really helped me get a good grasp on the fundamentals of digital photography, esp how the appeture (f/stop), shutter speed and ISO sensitivity inter-relate to one another.</p>
<p>I am thinking I'll also go along to their advanced workshop in a fortnights time aswell. It also didn't hurt that they lived in a beautiful setting out at Karana downs, they have the most incredible view out on to the river from their back deck which is just priceless. These are two shots I took pointed back up towards their house and I'm trying to decide which is a better shot.</p>

<p>    Oh and if you are interested in taking a class in digital photography I'd recommend getting in contact with them via their <a href="http://www.tesseraphoto.com/tesseraphoto/index.htm" title="Link outside of this blog">website</a>.</p>
