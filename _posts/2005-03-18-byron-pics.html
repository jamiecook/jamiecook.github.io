<p>Well last night was a total riot, Amelia and Shannon (from Bon Scotts)<br />
    had driven back up to brisbane for a bit of respite from touring and I<br />
    hitched a lift with them when they came back to Byron. We got down to<br />
    the Great Northern just before the boys went up to do a sound check. </p>
<p>    It was the first time that I'd heard the guys playing as Bon Scotts and<br />
    I was pleasantly suprised. I thought that the sound was a bit<br />
    reminescent of Gersey and Art of Fighting. Liam would SO fit in down in<br />
    Melbourne.</p>
<p>    The Fagan (or Faagan as it was misspelt on some shows) gig was pretty<br />
    spectacular aswell, lots of peeps on stage and a big full sound. Plus I<br />
    got to drink their rider so I was pretty happy. Then Dom gave me a lift<br />
    back to Brisbane last night which was fricking awesome - and he<br />
    remembered where I lived which is even better considering I was passed<br />
    out pretty good in the back of the car :)</p>
<p>    I'm trying out posting pics from last night... more later</p>
