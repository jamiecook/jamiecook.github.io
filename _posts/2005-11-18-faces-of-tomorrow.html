<p>Wow, this is a very cool concept. This guy has been around the world<br />
    photographing peoples faces in major cities around the world, he then<br />
    goes on to arrange composite images of the average male/female faces<br />
    from those cities to show the effects of <a href="http://www.faceoftomorrow.com" title="Link outside of this blog">multiculturalism and immigration patterns</a>.<br />
    This resonates very strongly with the concept of eigenfaces used<br />
    extensively within face recognition research, but in this case with a<br />
    much more artistic bent. Below I've shown what sydneyites might look<br />
    like in 100 years time.</p>
